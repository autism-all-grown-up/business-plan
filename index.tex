\chapter{Mission}\label{sec-mission}

\begin{quote}
The mission of Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) is to empower autistic adults
in Oregon by serving as a nexus that provides accessible information,
resources, and services tailored to their unique needs. By bridging gaps
in the existing infrastructure, we connect and interconnect the adult
autistic community and their supporters, facilitate information
exchange, and promote collaboration. This ensures that autistic
individuals can access the support and opportunities they need to
thrive, enhancing their well-being and independence throughout the
state.

\chapter{Executive Summary}\label{sec-executive_summary}

\section{Background}\label{sec-ex_sum_background}

Dr.~Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was
diagnosed with ADHD and ASD later in life and is raising a teenager with
both diagnoses. His desire to understand these challenges led him to
study the scientific and social aspects of neurodiversity. Recent
changes driven by autistic self-advocates and researchers have reshaped
our understanding of autism, revealing significant gaps in support for
autistic adults. These changes have led to controversies and arguments
that are still unfolding, emphasizing the evolving nature of the
understanding of autism.

Through his personal journey and interactions with the local autistic
community, Dr.~Balter identified significant gaps in services, support,
and understanding for autistic adults without intellectual disabilities.
He was struck by the level of unmet need he heard from his
peers---people with skills, education, and abilities but struggling for
reasons related to autism. These personal experiences led Dr.~Balter to
found Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) to address these gaps.

\section{Goals}\label{sec-ex_sum_goals}

Autism All Grown Up has four key objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Facilitate connections and collaboration within the adult autistic
  community
\item
  Identify the unmet needs of autistic adults and report on the causes
\item
  Provide accurate, accessible content \emph{for} autistic adults that
  we will continuously review and update as knowledge evolves
\item
  Provide accurate, accessible content \emph{about} autism and
  \emph{about} the autistic community that we will continuously review
  and update as knowledge evolves
\end{enumerate}

\section{Autism All Grown Up}\label{sec-ex_name}

Autism is all grown up now, and it isn't always pretty. The phrase ``All
Grown Up'' captures the bittersweet realization that often occurs when
one encounters an individual they knew as a child, only to find that
their preconceived notions no longer fit the adult standing before them.

For decades, autism was seen as a challenge that primarily affected
children. Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism have
caused adults to be overlooked by key stakeholders. Because so little
research has acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close
to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some
existing research suggests that autistic adults face reduced life
expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset
of age-related cognitive
concerns\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Mason2019}{1},\citeproc{ref-Mason2021}{2}}.
Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique
challenges with respect to aging, and most of these ``lost
generations''\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Wright2015}{3}--\citeproc{ref-Mason2022}{6}}
have not yet even been identified, accounted for, or documented.

\section{The Nexus Approach}\label{sec-ex_sum_nexus}

Rather than working on advocacy, Dr.~Balter feels he can more directly
serve the autistic community in Oregon by solving problems on the
ground. Systemic and societal problems can only be addressed through
advocacy. But many of the real-world problems can be solved without
waiting for systemic changes by increasing the connectivity and
information flow within existing infrastructure. Rather than being a hub
that consumes resources and provides services, AAGU will catalyze and
strengthen relationships around it to form a \emph{nexus}.

\chapter{Autism in 2024}\label{sec-autism2024}

\section{The New World of Autism}\label{the-new-world-of-autism}

Recent advancements in the understanding of autism, largely driven by
autistic self-advocates and researchers, have highlighted the need for a
paradigm shift in understanding, coexisting with, and when necessary,
supporting autistic individuals. \textless something about shift from
behavioral description to internal\textgreater{}\\
\strut \\
Key findings
include\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-ASAN2009}{7},\citeproc{ref-Weiss2023}{8}}:
\textless move these citations to where they belong\textgreater{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Lifelong Condition:}

  Autism is developmental. Autistic people carry their neurological and
  physiological differences through their entire lives. While society
  has been hyper-focused on autism in children, autism is not new to the
  human race. There are four times as many adults as children, so there
  are four times as many autistic adults as there are autistic children.
  \textless citations\textgreater{} \textless something else about focus
  on children\textgreater{}
\item
  \textbf{The Autism Spectrum is not Linear}

  Autistic people aren't ``more'' or ``less'' autistic so much as they
  are autistic in different ways.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb2ykmTM0TN/?hl=en&img_index=1}{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{media/autism_spectrum.jpeg}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-autism-spectrum}Figure 1. What the autism spectrum
means.}

\end{figure}%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Misconceptions:}

  New research has refuted many harmful misconceptions about autism.
  Some autistic people do have accompanying conditions that can result
  in problems with body awareness, identifying their emotional state, or
  using speech. However, autistic people do not intrinsically lack
  feelings, empathy, social skills, or the ability to communicate.
  \textless citations\textgreater{}

  Also, by the most current estimates, less than 1/3 of autistic people
  have intellectual or cognitive difficulties. Many autistic people who
  are unable to speak (for one or more reasons) do have language skills
  and can be competent writers and speakers with assistive technology.
  \textless citations\textgreater{}
\item
  \textbf{Disability can be Contextual:}

  Most autistic individuals are not intellectually or physically
  disabled but face substantial challenges navigating a neurotypical
  world. It can feel like being a left-handed person using right-handed
  scissors: difficult and unwieldy at best. \textless something about
  not wanting to be cured just have life easier\textgreater{}
  \textless citations\textgreater{}
\item
  \textbf{Not Just in the Brain:}

  Autism frequently comes with physiological differences that are just
  beginning to be understood and studied. Autistic people may experience
  higher or lower risk for certain diseases and conditions as well as
  different levels of physical abilities like flexibility. Many autistic
  people experience pain and other sensations differently.
  \textless citations\textgreater{} Few doctors are aware of these
  issues, and most are poorly trained in most aspects of supporting
  autistic patients. \textless citations\textgreater{}
\item
  \textbf{Double Empathy:}

  \textless Describe double empathy with citations\textgreater{}
\item
  \textbf{The True Challenges:}

  Many autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being
  autistic isn't being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that
  includes unconscious bias and
  ableism\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Sasson2017}{9}--\citeproc{ref-Praslova2021}{15}}.
  Research backs this up, indicating that discrimination, not autism, is
  a significant barrier in
  society\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Han2021}{16}}, especially in the
  workplace\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Raymaker2020}{17},\citeproc{ref-Roux2023}{18}}.
\item
  \textbf{Neurodiversity \& Neurodivergence:}

  The \emph{neurodiversity paradigm} recognizes autism as a natural
  variation in human neurology. Individuals with significantly atypical
  neurotypes are \emph{neurodivergent}, and sometimes need different
  things than \emph{neurotypical} people do.
\end{itemize}

\section{Lost Generations of Autistic
Adults}\label{sec-autism2024_lost_gen}

Research and services have predominantly focused on children and
neglected the needs of adults, especially those of us without profound
disabilities. Society has failed, and continues to fail, to adequately
study autistic life after high school when children lose many supports.
\textless citation\textgreater{}

Despite these challenges, many autistic adults possess valuable skills,
talents, and perspectives that society misses out on by not
acknowledging their needs, hearing their voices, and making room for
them at the table. \textless citation\textgreater{}

\section{Unmet Needs}\label{unmet-needs}

Autistic adults who are impacted more profoundly or who have
accompanying intellectual or cognitive challenges are generally able to
find support through systems of support designed for people with
disabilities. However, autistic adults without intellectual disabilities
often lack access to appropriate healthcare and support services, if
they even exist. \textless citation\textgreater{}

Autistic adults perceived as having lower support needs face a
conundrum. While we rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most
face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or
disbelieved. \textless citation\textgreater{}

\chapter{Autism All Grown Up (AAGU): A Nexus for Change}\label{sec-aagu}

\section{Origin}\label{sec-aagu_origin}

AAGU was born out of Dr.~Balter's desire to use his personal experiences
and analytical skills to help his newfound community. By conducting root
cause analyses and working with local organizations, he identified key
areas where AAGU could make an immediate impact, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Creating accessible guides for obtaining adult autism diagnoses
  through Oregon's Medicaid and Vocational Rehabilitation systems
\item
  Establishing \emph{The Uncommons}, autism-friendly co-working and
  community spaces
\item
  Improving online resources for autistic adults and providing
  consulting services to others to do the same
\item
  Participating in data analysis and research efforts to better
  understand the needs of autistic adults in Oregon
\end{itemize}

\section{What We Have Started}\label{sec-aagu_started}

AAGU has already made strides in achieving its objectives through
initiatives such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Partnering with Health Share Oregon to create guides for accessing
  autism assessments through Medicaid and developing a template Letter
  of Medical Necessity to facilitate evaluations through I/DD and
  Vocational Rehab programs
\item
  Securing temporary spaces for \emph{The Uncommons}, autism-friendly
  co-working and community spaces
\item
  Consulting with the Autism Society of Oregon to improve their online
  resources
\item
  Participating in the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder's
  data working group
\item
  Planning a State-wide conference to *******
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}\label{sec-aagu_goals}

Autism All Grown Up (AAGU) seeks to activate and empower the autistic
community in Oregon by improving communication channels and information
resources. Our immediate actions include:

\chapter{Funding}\label{funding}

We are poised to launch a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign as soon as we
have our nonprofit status confirmed by ARRO. We hope to raise seed money
of \$2k-\$3k per week to jump start formal operations ************* next
\$34k for our 8-week Sprout phase. We hope to launch the Sprout phase
within our first month.

A key element of our first 8 weeks of formal operation (Sprout) will be
to create a calendar of funding deadlines and communicate with funders
to prioritize our initial grant-writing efforts. It will also be crucial
that we complete the initial projects we have started during the Sprout
phase to demonstrate our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the
end of the Sprout phase, we will report to our umbrella organizations
and all funders/sponsors.

We are on the verge of launching a GoFundMe crowdsource campaign, a
crucial step that hinges on our nonprofit status being confirmed by
ARRO. The urgency is palpable as we aim to raise a substantial seed fund
of \$2k-\$3k per week, a total of \$34k, to kickstart our formal
operations. This will pave the way for our 8-week Sprout phase, which we
plan to initiate within our first month.

Our initial 8 weeks of formal operation, known as the Sprout phase, are
meticulously planned. We will create a comprehensive calendar of funding
deadlines and proactively communicate with funders to prioritize our
grant-writing efforts. Equally important is the completion of our
initial projects during this phase, which will serve as tangible proof
of our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout
phase, we will provide a detailed report to our umbrella organizations
and all funders/sponsors.

We have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships (see
Appendix~\ref{sec-potential-funders}) for which we meet the basic
requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g.~Oregon
Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source,
Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and
trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but
many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of
these are small pots of money, and others regularly award hundreds of
thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using
\emph{The Uncommons} co-working spaces.

During our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyze, and
disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with
a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise
will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts,
analysts, and report writers, providing another avenue for revenue. We
will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization
and our financial supporters.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\chapter{Budget}\label{sec-budget}

The kable format is: latex

Autism All Grown Up will place a strong emphasis on hiring autistic and
neurodiverse Oregon adults and paying them a market wage. The wages will
be at the low end during the initial Seed and Sprout phases and increase
during the later phases. The hourly rates shown represent full
compensation on a 1099 and do not include benefits. We will make
necessary adjustments when we are able to provide benefits as well.

We have created our budget estimate based on the minimum staffing we
believe can meet our performance goals combined with market-rate salary
estimates from
\href{https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries}{ZipRecruiter} for
approximate job titles in the Portland, OR area (see
Appendix~\ref{sec-representative-salaries}). We project a budget of
approximately \$150,000 for the first six months (26 weeks) of
operation.

\chapter{Special Issues and Concerns}\label{special-issues-and-concerns}

\section{The Services Cliff}\label{sec-services_cliff}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Services Cliff: Young autistic adults also face significant challenges
  transitioning out of high school, often referred to as the ``services
  cliff.'' This sudden drop-off in support can lead to difficulties in
  finding meaningful work, pursuing higher education, and living
  independently.
  {[}\url{https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/}{]}.
\end{itemize}

Transition to Adulthood This problem does not just affect existing
adults. The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has
become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by
both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is
what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be
offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will
they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open
doors in trade schools or collegFes and be offered the support they
might need?

\section{Access to Medical Care}\label{sec-access_to_care}

There is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging
autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to
successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades.
Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative,
compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are
ready and capable of doing this work. And they are the right people to
do it.

\section{Medical Training}\label{sec-training_for_providers}

Lack of training for healthcare providers

\section{Autism Research Funding
Priorities}\label{sec-research_funding_providers}

Despite the fact that advocates and researchers have been pushing for
decades to have autism research funding focus more on quality of life
and less on ``prevention and cure'', the trend has only gotten worse.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.4811in,height=\textheight]{./media/image1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2. Data from {[}Interagency Autism Coordination
Committee{]}(https://iacc.hhs.gov/funding/data/)}

\end{figure}%

\section{Intersectionally Marginalized Groups}\label{sec-marginalized}

All of these problems compound for members of intersectional populations
who may already be marginalized along other dimensions. Many researchers
believe that autism is\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Fombonne2022}{19}},
particularly in Black
communities\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Angell2018}{20}}, as well as
for\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-DMello2022}{21}}. Meanwhile, fluidity
in gender and sexual
orientation\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-George2018a}{22},\citeproc{ref-George2018}{23}}
is more highly represented among autistic people. Little research has
been done to assess how autism uniquely affects people in these
different subgroups.

\section{Physical and Mental Health}\label{sec-physical_mental_health}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Health and Well-being: Autistic adults experience higher rates of
  mental health issues, physical health disparities, and substantially
  elevated suicide risk
  {[}\url{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00463-7},
  \url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33407027/}{]}.
\item
  Social Isolation: Negative social experiences can lead to
  self-isolation, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and
  exclusion\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Loomes2017}{24}}
\end{itemize}

Across a variety of health domains, autistic people fare
worse\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-LodiSmith2021}{25},\citeproc{ref-LodiSmith2021a}{26}}.
Additionally, we are exposed to risks that are not of primary concern
for most people\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Muskens2017}{27}}. These
include autoimmune dysregulation of many kinds, autonomic dysregulation,
connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and many other
areas of health concern. A lack of understanding regarding these
differences, coupled with communication barriers and false notions about
autism all collude to create barriers to accessing health services and
care.

\section{Unemployment}\label{sec-unemployment}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Employment: Many autistic adults face difficulties finding and
  maintaining employment due to biases and lack of accommodations. In a
  study of 254 autistic adults, 77\% reported difficulties applying for
  jobs, and only 16\% are in full-time paid work
  {[}\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215190/},
  \url{https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.719827/full}{]}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Homelessness}\label{sec-homelessness}

Barriers to entry to the workplace, as well as challenges and holding
jobs due to ablest attitudes or inflexible policies, put us at risk of
severe financial strain\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Ohl2017}{28}}.
This, coupled with the possibility of reduced social support, increases
our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to
investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism
in homeless populations are much higher than that observed in the
general public and may be ten times
higher\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Churchard2019}{29}}. Autistic
people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services
for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of
providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic
people\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Kargas2019}{30}}.

\section{Suicide}\label{sec-suicide}

As a group, their suicide risk may be two to seven times higher than the
risk for youth and adults who do not have autism. When researchers took
into account psychiatric conditions that increase suicide risk, such as
depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, autistic people
still had a higher risk than the comparison group
{[}@\textbar autism2022{]}. The International Society for Autism
Research says ``Suicide in autism is a hidden crisis, overlooked by
policymakers, clinicians and researchers worldwide.'' and highlights
three barriers: a lack of evidence-based assessment tools and
interventions to identify and treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors; a
lack of access to mental health services10 and exclusion from
conversations about policies and guidelines that affect autistic
people.''\textsuperscript{\citeproc{ref-Cassidy2021}{31}}

\chapter{Glossary}\label{sec-glossary}

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[ADLs]
When a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we
look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living.
Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service
priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of
Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that
are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR
411-015-0006
\url{https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx}
\item[Alexithymia]
Alexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and
describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional
blindness. \url{https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963}
\item[Asperger's Syndrome]
Asperger's syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part
of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013,
Asperger's syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
revised criteria.
\url{https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome}
\item[Co-Occurring Conditions]
The preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for
``comorbid'' for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly
found along with autism.
\item[Double Empathy]
Double empathy refers to how: 1. It is easier to understand the mindset
of people who are similar to you 2. It is more difficult to understand
the mindset of those who are different from you This concept was
specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton
to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It
explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived
experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived
experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at
understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding
other allistics.
\url{https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-double-empathy-problem/}
\item[Dyslexia]
Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects
reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these
skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic
people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they
see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy
skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational
skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking
differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as
reasoning and in visual and creative fields.
\url{https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia}
\item[Dyspraxia]
Dyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and
coordination. It's not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people
use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is
developmental coordination disorder (DCD).
\url{https://www.understood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia}
\item[fMRI]
Functional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your
brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you
were doing at the time can help ``map'' your brain activity. It's most
often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain.
\url{https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri}
\item[Gender identity]
One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or
neither -- how individuals perceive themselves and what they call
themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from
their sex assigned at birth.
\url{https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions}
\item[Genome]
The genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In
humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the
cell's nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell's
mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an
individual to develop and function.
\url{https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome}
\item[Health Share Oregon]
One of Oregon's Community Care Organizations (CCO) for OHP.

\item[I/DD]
Oregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities.
\item[Letter of Medical Necessity]
A Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the
treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment,
or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of
their accepted work-related illness(es).
\url{https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance/Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf}
\item[Neurodivergent]
See Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence
\item[Neurodiversity]
See Appendix 4: Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence
\item[Non-Speaking]
When an autistic person doesn't speak, it's known as nonspeaking autism.
You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term
nonverbal isn't completely accurate, since it means ``without words.
Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in
other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that
are spoken to them or that they overhear.
\url{https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism}
\item[OCD]
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have
recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get
rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively
(compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning,
checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities,
can significantly interfere with a person's daily activities and social
interactions.

\item[ODDS]
Oregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services
\item[OHP]
Oregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid
\item[Services Cliff]
Many high school students on the autism spectrum get help through
special education -- most commonly including speech-language therapy,
service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special
transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and
family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for
young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary
services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth
through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day
of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends.
\url{https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/}
\item[Sexual orientation]
An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual
attraction to other people. Note: an individual's sexual orientation is
independent of their gender identity.
\url{https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions}
\item[Synesthesia]
Synesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through
multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense
simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to
numbers and letters. It's not a medical condition, and many people find
it useful to help them learn and remember information.
\url{https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia}
\item[Theory of Mind]
In psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other
people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the
knowledge that others' beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and
thoughts may be different from one's own. Possessing a functional theory
of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions.
People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring
others' behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind
primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors
including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive
delays, age, and culture can affect a person's capacity to display
theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical
with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy.

\chapter{Neurodiversity and Neurodivergence}\label{sec-neurodiversity}

Many people find
\href{https://neuroqueer.com/neurodiversity-terms-and-definitions/}{\ul{this
article}} by Dr.~Nick Walker to be the definitive overview of these
terms and how they are used and misused. We put together the summary
below with the help of
\href{https://chatgpt.com/share/e60ffdec-5945-45d2-9a14-2abe39cf4f8d}{\ul{chatGPT}}:

\section{Neurodiversity (concept)}\label{neurodiversity-concept}

\textbf{Definition:} Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological
differences, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, are natural
variations of the human genome. This concept emphasizes that these
differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human
diversity.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} The term ``neurodiversity'' was
coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the
disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which
sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views
neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured. Instead,
neurodiversity advocates promote acceptance and understanding,
emphasizing the strengths and contributions of neurodivergent
individuals.

\section{Neurodiversity (paradigm)}\label{neurodiversity-paradigm}

\textbf{Definition:} The neurodiversity paradigm is a framework that
challenges traditional views of neurological differences. It posits that
these differences should be seen as normal variations rather than
abnormalities or deficits. This paradigm promotes the idea that society
should adapt to accommodate these differences rather than forcing
individuals to conform to a neurotypical standard.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} This paradigm shift gained
momentum in the early 2000s, aligning with broader social movements
advocating for civil rights and inclusion. It has influenced fields like
education, employment, and healthcare, encouraging practices that
support diverse ways of thinking and learning.

\section{Neurodiversity (movement)}\label{neurodiversity-movement}

\textbf{Definition:} The neurodiversity movement is a social movement
that advocates for the rights and inclusion of neurodivergent
individuals. It seeks to promote understanding, acceptance, and
accommodation of neurological differences. The movement has worked to
reframe autism as a minority identity rather than a disorder.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} Emerging in the late 20th
century, the neurodiversity movement has been driven by self-advocates
and allies. It challenges stigmatizing narratives and calls for systemic
changes in how neurodivergent individuals are treated in society. This
movement has led to increased visibility and advocacy for policies that
support neurodiversity in schools, workplaces, and communities.

\section{Neurodivergence}\label{neurodivergence}

\textbf{Definition:} Neurodivergence refers to the state of having a
brain that functions differently from the typical standards of society.
It is an umbrella term that includes various neurological conditions
like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} The term ``neurodivergence''
gained prominence alongside the neurodiversity movement. It helps to
create a more inclusive language that recognizes the spectrum of
neurological differences without implying pathology. This shift in
terminology supports a more positive and accepting view of diverse
cognitive profiles.

\section{Neurodivergent}\label{neurodivergent}

\textbf{Definition:} Neurodivergent describes individuals whose
neurological development and functioning are atypical. This term is used
to identify people who have conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, etc.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} The adoption of the term
``neurodivergent'' reflects a growing acceptance of diversity in
neurological functioning. It emphasizes identity and self-advocacy,
allowing individuals to claim their differences as part of who they are
rather than as something to be fixed or hidden.

\section{Neurotypical}\label{neurotypical}

\textbf{Definition:} Neurotypical refers to individuals whose
neurological development and functioning are considered standard or
typical by societal norms. It is often used in contrast to
neurodivergent.

\textbf{Historical and Social Context:} The term ``neurotypical''
originated within the neurodiversity community as a way to distinguish
between those who conform to societal norms of neurological functioning
and those who do not. It highlights that ``typical'' neurological
functioning is not the only valid or acceptable way of being, promoting
a more inclusive view of human diversity.
