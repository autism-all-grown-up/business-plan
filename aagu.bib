  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently identified in children but is often unrecognised in adults. ASD is characterised by difficulties in social interaction, communication and restricted interests, but other presentations are common, especially in adults. This report describes a 34-year-old man with a history of multiple psychiatric diagnoses including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and panic disorder. He was diagnosed with ASD in his early 30s and engaged in a targeted treatment plan, including rationalisation of medications, supportive therapy and occupational therapy, which successfully facilitated discharge from mental health services. This case illustrates the atypical presentation of ASD in adults, which is diagnostically challenging. Such cases often present to community mental health services and may be misdiagnosed as treatment resistant cases of depressive, anxiety or personality disorders. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management is more likely to yield a successful outcome.},

  abstract = {Successful social interactions are assumed to depend on theory of mind—the ability to represent others’ mental states—yet most studies of the relation between theory of mind and social-interactive success rely on non-interactive tasks that do not adequately capture the spontaneous engagement of theory of mind, a crucial component of everyday social interactions. We addressed this gap by establishing a novel observational rating scale to measure the spontaneous use of theory of mind (or lack thereof) within naturalistic conversations (conversational ToM; cToM). In 50 age- and gender-matched dyads of autistic and typically developing youth aged 8–16\,years (three dyad types: autistic–typically developing, typically developing–typically developing, autistic–autistic), we assessed cToM during 5-min unstructured conversations. We found that ratings on the cToM Negative scale, reflecting theory-of-mind-related violations of neurotypical conversational norms, were negatively associated with two forms of non-interactive theory of mind: visual-affective and spontaneous. In contrast, the cToM Positive scale, reflecting explicit mental state language and perspective-taking, was not associated with non-interactive theory of mind. Furthermore, autistic youth were rated higher than typically developing youth on cToM Negative, but the groups were rated similarly on cToM Positive. Together, these findings provide insight into multiple aspects of theory of mind in conversation and reveal a nuanced picture of the relative strengths and difficulties among autistic youth. Lay abstract Conversation is a key part of everyday social interactions. Previous studies have suggested that conversational skills are related to theory of mind, the ability to think about other people’s mental states, such as beliefs, knowledge, and emotions. Both theory of mind and conversation are common areas of difficulty for autistic people, yet few studies have investigated how people, including autistic people, use theory of mind during conversation. We developed a new way of measuring cToM using two rating scales: cToM Positive captures behaviors that show consideration of a conversation partner’s mental states, such as referring to their thoughts or feelings, whereas cToM Negative captures behaviors that show a lack of theory of mind through violations of neurotypical conversational norms, such as providing too much, too little, or irrelevant information. We measured cToM in 50 pairs of autistic and typically developing children (ages 8–16\,years) during 5-min “getting to know you” conversations. Compared to typically developing children, autistic children displayed more frequent cToM Negative behaviors but very similar rates of cToM Positive behaviors. Across both groups, cToM Negative (but not Positive) ratings were related to difficulties in recognizing emotions from facial expressions and a lower tendency to talk about others’ mental states spontaneously (i.e., without being instructed to do so), which suggests that both abilities are important for theory of mind in conversation. Altogether, this study highlights both strengths and difficulties among autistic individuals, and it suggests possible avenues for further research and for improving conversational skills.},

  abstract = {Health care continuity during the transition from pediatric to adult care is critical to helping individuals with autism spectrum disorders manage complex medical and psychiatric co-morbidities that start in childhood and evolve with age. We conducted a brief online survey of pediatric and adult providers at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system, to assess departmental policies and personal approaches to transitioning patients with special health care needs, including autism spectrum disorders. A total of 354 pediatric (43\% response rate) and 715 adult providers (30\% response rate) completed the survey. A large majority of departments did not have transition policies in place. Many providers in both primary care and mental health did not provide transition resources, review legal changes, use standardized assessment tools, or communicate with the next/previous provider. Transition planning was usually delayed until age 17 or later. Most providers did not have consistent approaches to the transition of care for youth with special health care needs and may be inadequately prepared to handle the process for patients with autism spectrum disorders. As the population of transition-age youth with autism spectrum disorders continues to grow, there is urgent need to understand how to best implement transition policies that promote early communication between providers and families and track outcomes among transitioning patients with special health care needs. Lay Abstract The transition from pediatric to adult care is a critical inflection point for the long-term health of youth with autism spectrum disorders and other special health care needs. However, for many patients, their caregivers, and providers, the transition lacks coordination. This survey study demonstrates that pediatric and adult providers struggle to implement many components of transition best practices for youth with autism and other chronic conditions, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced medical coordination and additional transition training and resources.},

With so many people affected by our growing culture of disabilities,” it no longer makes sense to hold on to the deficit-ridden idea of neuropsychological illness.With the sensibility of Oliver Sacks and Kay Redfield Jamison, psychologist Thomas Armstrong offers a revolutionary perspective that reframes many neuropsychological disorders as part of the natural diversity of the human brain rather than as definitive illnesses. Neurodiversity emphasizes their positive dimensions, showing how people with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and other conditions have inherent evolutionary advantages that, matched with the appropriate environment or ecological niche, can help them achieve dignity and wholeness in their lives.},

Yet, a number of case reports have revealed that mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed in autistic individuals. A total of 420 adults who identified as autistic, possibly autistic or non-autistic completed an online survey consisting of questions regarding mental health diagnoses they received, whether they agreed with those diagnoses and if not why. Autistic and possibly autistic participants were more likely to report receiving mental health diagnoses compared to non-autistic participants, but were less likely to agree with those diagnoses. Thematic analysis revealed the participants' main reasons for disagreement were that (1) they felt their autism characteristics were being confused with mental health conditions by healthcare professionals and (2) they perceived their own mental health difficulties to be resultant of ASC. Participants attributed these to the clinical barriers they experienced, including healthcare professionals' lack of autism awareness and lack of communication, which in turn prevented them from receiving appropriate support. This study highlights the need for autism awareness training for healthcare professionals and the need to develop tools and interventions to accurately diagnose and effectively treat mental health conditions in autistic individuals.},

The primary aim of this cross-sectional study design was to identify potential knowledge gaps that were present among medical students and pediatric trainees (interns, residents, and fellows) particularly during the management of a sick child with ASD. Methods: A 23-question online survey was developed and distributed to medical students and pediatric trainees at a tertiary children's hospital affiliated with a medical school. Results: Medical students and pediatric trainees reported a low general knowledge of ASD and were unfamiliar with sensory issues that is often present in these children. Increased discomfort and insufficient didactic and clinical training for providing care to children with ASD during an acute illness were also identified. Both medical students and trainees reported the need for increased education and training, preferentially via patient interaction and small group-based learning. We found that as education/training levels increased, participants perceived increased comfort and knowledge in managing an ill child with ASD. Conclusions: A perceived knowledge gap and discomfort is present amongst medical students and pediatric trainees on the management of children with ASD. Across all education levels, awareness for sensory dysregulation in ASD children is low. Education programs using direct patient interaction and small group learning were the preferred training modalities to learn how to provide optimal care for children with ASD.},

The aim of this study is to systematically and meta-analytically examine the following: (i) the prevalence of an OCD diagnosis among young people with ASD, (ii) the prevalence of an ASD diagnosis among young people with OCD, and (iii) the clinical and therapeutic implications of such comorbidity. Method: A multistep literature search was performed from database inception until 17 November 2023. This PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023480543), identified studies reporting on the prevalence, sociodemographic, psychopathologic, prognostic, and therapeutic correlates of OCD and ASD concurrence in children and adolescents. A quantitative meta-analysis with random effects was conducted to analyse the pooled prevalence of OCD among samples with a mean age of {$<$} 18 years old with ASD and the prevalence of ASD among individuals under 18 with OCD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effect of diagnostic criteria and different continents. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of gender, age, IQ, and OCD severity scores. A narrative review of the clinical and therapeutical implications of the comorbidity was provided. Results: 42 studies were selected for the systematic review (SR), and 31 of them were also included in one of the meta-analyses. The pooled prevalence of OCD among ASD youth samples (n = 8916, mean age = 10.6 ± 1.6; 16.4\% female) was 11.6\% (95\% confidence intervals [CI] = 6.9\%; 18.8\%), and the pooled prevalence of ASD among OCD children and adolescent samples (n = 6209, mean age = 14.1 ± 1.4; 45.7\% female) was 9.5\% (95\% CI = 6.0\%; 14.7\%). Meta-regressions found a statistically higher prevalence of ASD among samples with a lower prevalence of females (β = −4.7; 95\%CI = −8.6; −0.8). Children with both OCD and ASD present higher rates of functional impairment, psychopathology, and other comorbidities, compared to youth with either of the disorders alone. Conclusions: OCD and ASD are highly concurrent conditions in youth, with symptomatic, prognostic, severity, and therapeutic implications. Future research should focus on conducting longitudinal cohort studies prospectively to determine development trajectories, along with randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of specific therapeutic interventions.},

Negative attitudes toward disability disempower individuals with disabilities and lead to their social exclusion and isolation. By contrast, a healthy society encourages positive attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and promotes social inclusion. The current review explored disability perception in the light of the in-group vs. out-group dichotomy, since individuals with disabilities may be perceived as a special case of out-group. We implemented a developmental approach to study perception of disability from early age into adolescence while exploring cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of children's attitudes. Potential factors influencing perception of disability were considered at the level of society, family and school environment, and the individual. Better understanding of factors influencing the development of disability perception would allow the design of effective interventions to improve children's attitudes toward peers with disabilities, reduce intergroup biases, and promote social inclusion. Based on previous research in social and developmental psychology, education, and anthropology, we proposed an integrative model that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the development of disability perception.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a `theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a `theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

This study describes the physical and mental health of a unique sample of all middle aged and older Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and tests differences between those with and without co-occurring intellectual disability. Method Using de-identified Medicaid claims data for 143 adults with a recorded autism spectrum disorder diagnosis aged 40–88 years with any Wisconsin Medicaid claims in 2012 through 2015, we extracted diagnoses for physical and mental health conditions from fee-for-service claims. Logistic regression analyses—controlling for sex, race, and age—compared the adjusted odds of physical and mental health conditions for those with and without intellectual disability. Results Many physical and mental health conditions, including immune conditions (70.6\%), cardiovascular disease (49.0\%) and its risk factors (46.2\%), sleep disorders (85.3\%), gastrointestinal disorders (49.7\%), neurologic conditions (55.9\%), and psychiatric disorders (72.0\%) were highly prevalent in our full sample. Although there were many similarities between those individuals with and without co-occurring intellectual disability, middle aged and older adults on the autism spectrum had higher prevalence of epilepsy and lower prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to those without co-occurring intellectual disability. Conclusions Findings suggest that people on the autism spectrum have a high prevalence of physical and mental health conditions in midlife and old age, regardless of intellectual disability status.},

Internationally, there remains limited understanding of the factors influencing employment across the stages of preparing for, gaining, and maintaining employment. This is the third in a series of studies conducted as part of an International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) policy brief intended to improve employment outcomes for autistic individuals. A multi-informant international survey with five key stakeholder groups, including autistic individuals, their families, employers, service providers, and researchers, was undertaken in Australia, Sweden, and the United States to understand the facilitators and barriers to employment for autistic adults. A total of 687 individuals participated, including autistic individuals (n = 246), family members (n = 233), employers (n = 35), clinicians/service providers (n = 123), and researchers (n = 50). Perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to employment differed significantly across both key stakeholder groups and countries, however, ensuring a good job match and focusing on strengths were identified by all groups as important for success. Key barriers to employment included stigma, a lack of understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and communication difficulties. Results suggest that a holistic approach to employment for autistic individuals is required, aimed at facilitating communication between key stakeholders, addressing attitudes and understanding of ASD in the workplace, using strength-based approaches and providing early work experience.

Other possible explanations for mental health problems among autistic populations have received little attention. As evidenced by the minority disability movement, autism is increasingly being considered part of the identities of autistic people. Autistic individuals thus constitute an identity-based minority and may be exposed to excess social stress as a result of disadvantaged and stigmatized social status. The authors test the utility of the minority stress model as an explanation for the experience of mental health problems within a sample of high-functioning autistic individuals (n = 111). Minority stressors including everyday discrimination, internalized stigma, and concealment significantly predicted poorer mental health, despite controlling for general stress exposure. These results indicate the potential utility of minority stress in explaining increased mental health problems in autistic populations. Implications for research and clinical applications are discussed.},

Greater inclusion of autistic people in research predicted significantly lower odds of ableist cues, while controlling for other contact with autistic people and career length. Next, we used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze researcher's perceptions of autistic people and autism research. Narratives reflected core ideological disagreements of the field, such as whether researchers consider autism to be an intrinsic barrier to a good life, and whether researchers prioritize research which tackles “autism” versus barriers to societal inclusion for autistic people. Instrumentality (a form of objectification) was key to whether researchers considered a person to have social value with emphasis revolving around intellectual ability and independence. Lastly, language seemed to act as a tool of normalization of violence. Researchers relied on an amorphous idea of “autism” when talking about prevention or eradication, potentially because it sounds more palatable than talking about preventing “autistic people,” despite autism only existing within the context of autistic people.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$>$}},

This qualitative study aimed to understand how autistic individuals make sense of their own autism and experience the stigma attached to autism. The study used critical grounded theory tools. Participants (N = 20) discussed autism as central to their identity, and integral to who they are. While participants thought of autism as value neutral, they expressed how society confers negative meanings onto autism, and thus, them. The findings also indicate that different understandings of autism confer different levels of stigma. Participants expressed constant exposure to stigma and managed this stigma in different ways. Such methods included reframing to more positive understandings of autism, the reclamation of language, and using concealment and disclosure strategically. The implications of these findings are discussed further in the article.Points of interestAutistic research participants consider their autism to be value neutral – akin to any other feature like race or hair colour.Participants feel that society sees their autism as being a bad trait to have.Participants struggled with the tension in how they see themselves, versus how they believe society sees them.Participants are caught between disclosing that they are autistic and concealing it, but feel they are treated negatively either way.Participants use the word “autistic” to reclaim autism from stigma, and to reframe peoples understandings of autism to be less negative.

'Neurodiversity' means the same thing as 'neurological diversity' and does not change the theory in any way.

It is concluded that impaired ToM by itself has only limited explanatory power, but that explorations of the psychological precursors of impaired ToM have been fruitful in increasing understanding of mindreading impairments in ASD (where ‘mindreading’ refers those abilities that underlie triadic interaction as well as ToM). It is argued that early explanations of impaired mindreading are untenable for various reasons, but that impairments of dyadic interaction in ASD that could lead to impaired ability to represent others’ mental states may be the critical psychological cause, or causes, of impaired ToM. The complexity of causal routes to impaired ToM is emphasized.},

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate autistic people's views on the importance and availability of adjustments to mental and physical healthcare provision. To explore whether specific categories of adjustments can be identified and to identify any differences in their importance and availability between mental and physical healthcare. Design Data from two studies, both employing a cross-sectional survey design. Setting UK-based autistic adults registered with the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-UK were contacted by post or online. In both studies, recruitment was staged over a 12-month period. Non-responders were sent a single reminder letter 2 weeks after initial contact. Participants 537 autistic adults completed a survey about mental health services (51\% response rate), 407 completed the physical health survey (49\% response rate). Within these samples, 221 participants completed both surveys. Primary outcome measures Each study developed a bespoke survey to explore participants' views on mental and physical health services, respectively. Both included an identical list of adjustments that participants rated based on importance and availability. Results Three factors of important adjustments were identified: sensory environment, clinical and service context, and clinician knowledge and communication. Adjustments across healthcare settings were widely rated as being important yet rarely available. One significant difference between the importance of adjustments available through mental and physical health services was identified. Participants reported that having access to a clinician who is willing to adapt their approach to suit the person's preferences was significantly more important for participants attending mental health settings (p=0.001). Conclusions Autistic people reported the limited availability of important adjustments in current healthcare provision. To address unmet need and tackle the health inequalities faced by autistic people attending physical and mental healthcare settings, healthcare providers should offer adjustments relating to the three identified factors. Future research should focus on identifying and addressing service provider barriers to implementation.},

  abstract = {Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by impairments in the cognitive processes and in the tasks of daily life. It encompasses a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders often associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Social and communication abilities are strongly compromised in ASD. The prevalence of ID/ASD is 1–3\%, and approximately 30\% of the patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Considering the extreme genetic locus heterogeneity, next-generation sequencing approaches have provided powerful tools for candidate gene identification. Molecular diagnosis is crucial to improve outcome, prevent complications, and hopefully start a therapeutic approach. Here, we performed parent–offspring trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 60 mostly syndromic ID/ASD patients and we detected 8 pathogenic variants in genes already known to be associated with ID/ASD (SYNGAP1, SMAD6, PACS1, SHANK3, KMT2A, KCNQ2, ACTB, and POGZ). We found four de novo disruptive variants of four novel candidate ASD/ID genes: MBP, PCDHA1, PCDH15, PDPR. We additionally selected via bioinformatic tools many variants in unknown genes that alone or in combination can contribute to the phenotype. In conclusion, our data confirm the efficacy of WES in detecting pathogenic variants of known and novel ID/ASD genes.},

Results showed that knowledge of autism was comparable to past research and females were more open towards autism. Findings also indicated evidence for dehumanisation, with a particular denial of 'human uniqueness' traits. Furthermore, dehumanisation was related to openness towards autism. These findings have implications for targeting attitudes to reduce stigma associated with autism.},

If social deficits are paramount, then we expect autistic people to have difficulty navigating social hierarchies. We reject the premise of social deficits (while acknowledging that social misunderstandings interfere in the daily life of autistics) but suggest that researchers learn by listening to what autistic adults say about social hierarchies. We review writings by autistic people, including advice books, memoirs, book reviews, online discussion posts, and the mission-statement of an autistic-led organization. These suggest that autistic people find status-seeking illogical and prefer egalitarian relationships. The consistency of these themes across different types of writings is a reason for researchers to systematically study reduced status-seeking in autistic individuals.},

  abstract = {Background:~           People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have an increased susceptibility for many chronic health conditions compared with their peers. An increasing number of adolescents are transitioning from pediatric to adult healthcare services. Thus, being able to access appropriate healthcare services that can not only address specific needs of the person but enable them to better manage healthcare conditions and decrease the development of preventable disease is necessary. A systematic review was conducted to identify barriers and enablers of healthcare access for autistic adults.           Methods:~           The studies included in the review were quantitative and qualitative and were published between 2003 and 2019. The participants for the review are considered to be adults (over 18 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of ASD.           Results:~           In total, 1290 studies were initially identified and 13 studies were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in a previous protocol paper. The analysis of these studies identified areas of concern to access appropriate healthcare, such as clinician knowledge, the environment, and life events.           Conclusion:~           Identifying the barriers to healthcare, highlights ways healthcare services can regulate scope of practice, the physical environment, and the process of managing health conditions, thus, autistic adults can strive for optimal health. This review contributes to peer-reviewed evidence for future research and up-to-date information when developing and piloting health interventions for autistic adults.           Ethics and dissemination:~           There are no human participants, data, or tissue being directly studied for the purposes of the review; therefore, ethics approval and consent to participate is not applicable.

Thematic analysis of open-ended questions resulted in an overarching theme that individually tailored treatment and support was both beneficial and desirable, which consisted of three underlying themes: (1) difficulties in accessing treatment and support; (2) lack of understanding and knowledge of autistic people with co-occurring mental health difficulties and (3) appropriate treatment and support, or lack of, impacted autistic people's well-being and likelihood of seeing suicide as their future.

This has resulted in a lack of research relevant to the day to day lives of autistic people. To address this, INSAR's 2021 policy brief aimed to identify the top 10 priorities to prevent suicide in partnership with autistic people and their allies. First, seven international workshops involving autistic, researcher, charity and service provider perspectives, discussed and identified 48 priorities to prevent suicide in autism. Second, an online survey, with equal weighted representation of autistic people and those who support them, prioritised and refined this longer list of priorities into the top 20 for discussion at a 2-day meeting. Third, the INSAR policy brief meeting brought together equal representation of autistic people and those who, support them to identify the top 10 research priorities, and implications for policy and practice, to prevent suicide in autistic people. This policy brief presents the autism community top 10 research priorities, and community recommendations for public policy and practice to prevent suicide in autistic people. Research which positively affects the lives of autistic people can only be achieved in close partnership between autistic people and their allies. It is important that we learn from examples of participatory working, such as this INSAR policy brief, to ensure that autistic people have a strong voice in the direction of future international research, public policy and practice. This will help ensure that autism research, policy initiatives, services, support and treatment are useful to autistic people.},

In recent years, however, problematic findings regarding the biological underpinnings of autism; historical research examining the shifting nature of the categorization; and a lack of biomedical utility have led some to suggest abandoning the concept of autism. My interest here is the possibility that autism may remain a meaningful and helpful classification even if it lacks scientific validity and biomedical utility. After arguing that accounts of autism as a psychiatric classification are unsustainable, I draw on feminist philosopher Iris Marion-Young's distinction between groups and serial collectives in order to account for the reality of autism as a social category, best framed in terms of a social model of disability. When it is taken as a serial collective, I argue, we can coherently understand autistic people as forming a marginalized minority, disabled in relation to the specific material and social contexts, yet in a way that avoids neuro-centric commitments. Autism is thus real and valuable for political and ethical rather than biomedical reasons.},

In this participatory study, a team of autistic and non-autistic researchers asked autistic ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 92) and non-autistic ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 774) university students about their career aspirations, strengths they believe will help them succeed in their “dream jobs,” and obstacles they expect to encounter. Autistic participants' top goal in attending college was to improve their career prospects. However, relatively few autistic students reported learning career-specific skills at university. Autistic students were more likely to seek an academic job and less likely to seek a career in healthcare than non-autistic students. Autistic students highlighted writing skills and detail orientation as strengths that could help them succeed in their dream jobs more often than non-autistic students. However, they were also more likely to expect discrimination, social, and psychological difficulties to stand in the way of their dream jobs. These findings suggest that universities should prioritize experiential learning opportunities to help autistic (and non-autistic) students develop employment-related skills while providing mental health supports. Universities should demonstrate their commitment to supporting diverse learners by seeking out and hiring autistic professionals and by teaching their own staff and employers how to appreciate and support autistic colleagues.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age—particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9\% Female; 1.1\% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. Lay Summary Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.},

As a step towards filling this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism symptoms in a group of long-term homeless people. The entire caseload ( N\,=\,106) of a UK homeless outreach team was screened (excluding individuals born outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland) using an in-depth, semi-structured interview with keyworkers, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic criteria. This showed adequate inter-rater reliability, as well as evidence of criterion and construct validity. Of the sample, 13 people (12.3\%, 95\% confidence interval (7.0, 20.4)) screened positive, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism criteria by keyworker report. A further nine people (8.5\%, 95\% confidence interval (4.5, 15.3)) were 'marginal', having autistic traits that were not quite sufficient to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Those with elevated autistic traits, compared to those without, tended to be more socially isolated and less likely to use substances. This study has provided initial evidence that autistic traits are over-represented among homeless people and that autistic homeless people may show a distinct pattern of characteristics and needs. Further investigation is required to build upon these provisional findings.},

  abstract = {One in 44 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Despite this, physicians receive little clinical training, inclusive of autistic patients. It is therefore not surprising that physicians report low levels of confidence in their ability to provide care to autistic individuals. This review examines the impact of specialized training programs on physicians’ knowledge of autism and their self-efficacy and practice behavior related to caring for autistic patients. A search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed to identify studies evaluating specialized autism training programs for physicians or physician trainees. Seventeen studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. The Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument was utilized to objectively measure the quality of the included studies. Based on the results reported in these studies, specialized autism training programs were associated with positive changes in physician knowledge and self-efficacy related to the care of autistic patients. Other than short-term increases in screening for autism, no other changes in physician behavior were studied. These results call for the development and evaluation of autism training programs that focus on improving physician behavior and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Autism is increasingly seen as a social identity, as well as a clinical diagnosis. Evidence suggests that autistic adults who have stronger autism social identification have better psychological well-being. Autism is a condition which impacts on social interactions, and so one’s sense of autism identification may be particularly important for reducing social anxiety, which is common in autistic adolescents. We aimed to investigate how the subcomponents of autism identification relate to social anxiety in autistic young people. We hypothesised that autistic young people who had a higher satisfaction with their autism identity, and more solidarity with other autistic people, would have better psychological well-being and lower social anxiety. 121 autistic young people between the ages of 15–22 completed questionnaires measuring self-reported autism traits, social anxiety, psychological well-being, and different components of autism social identification. We conducted regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and autism traits. We found that higher autism satisfaction was associated with higher psychological well-being and lower social anxiety. Young people with higher autism solidarity had higher psychological well-being, but there was no significant relationship between solidarity and social anxiety. We conclude that it is important to support autistic young people to develop autism social identification. Lay abstract Autism is a diagnosis given to individuals by professionals but is also increasingly seen as an identity which an individual can choose for themselves. We wanted to explore how having autism as an identity affects autistic young people. There is evidence that autistic adults have better psychological well-being when they feel more solidarity with other autistic people and feel positively about being autistic. We know that autistic teenagers often feel anxious in social situations. Having a positive autism identity might help alleviate social anxiety associated with being autistic. We wanted to find out if autistic young people who felt more solidarity with other autistic people, and had more positive feelings about autism, had better psychological well-being and less social anxiety. We asked 121 autistic people aged 15–22\,years to complete some questionnaires. These questionnaires asked about the young person’s autism traits, social anxiety, and psychological well-being. The questionnaires also asked how satisfied they felt to be autistic (satisfaction) and how much solidarity they felt with the autism community (solidarity). We found that autistic young people who had higher autism satisfaction had better psychological well-being and lower social anxiety. Young people who felt more solidarity with other autistic people had higher psychological well-being. There was no association between autism solidarity and social anxiety. We conclude that is important to support autistic young people to develop positive feelings about autism and to feel solidarity with other autistic people.},

  abstract = {Introduction: At present, very few autistic people are employed, even though many want to be. It is important that their strengths are identified and valued to help them to find jobs that they enjoy, and that make good use of their skills. The aim of this study was to investigate what strengths autistic people have in the workplace, self-reported by autistic people themselves. Methods: In this study, autistic participants (n\,=\,66) completed an online questionnaire that asked their views about employment-related strengths that they experienced. We analyzed these data using thematic analysis to identify commonalities across participants' experiences, and areas where they felt that they could perform better than their nonautistic colleagues. Results: The main strengths identified from these data revealed cognitive advantages such as superior creativity, focus, and memory; increased efficiency and personal qualities such as honesty and dedication; and the ability to offer a unique autism-specific perspective. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests that autistic people have many employment-related strengths that should be recognized and valued by autistic people and employers alike. By understanding the strengths that could be associated with autism in the workplace, autistic people may be better able to identify their own strengths in the workplace (with the help of support workers, where necessary). The results should also encourage employers to make an effort to recruit and retain autistic employees, making appropriate adjustments to interview processes and working conditions, and seeking out training when needed. Why was this study done? At the moment, very few autistic people are employed, even though many want to be. One reason for this might be that nonautistic people focus on things that autistic people find difficult, and ignore things that autistic people can do well. To address this, it is important to make people more aware of strengths that autistic people have, and make sure that they are valued. What was the purpose of this study? We did this study to find out what strengths autistic people have in the workplace, as suggested by autistic people themselves. What did the researchers do? In this study, we asked autistic people to fill out an online questionnaire that asked their views about the strengths that they experienced at work. A total of 66 people completed the questionnaire. We read through everyone's answers, and put them into groups of similar responses. In that way, we could identify the areas where the autistic participants felt that they could perform better than their nonautistic colleagues. What were the results of the study? The participants in our study wrote about many areas of strength and skill at work. The main strengths that they mentioned were advantages related to ways of thinking (like being able to pay attention to tasks well), getting tasks done more efficiently, and personal qualities such as honesty and dedication. They also wrote about how being autistic meant that they could offer a unique view on situations at work. What do these findings add to what was already known? This was the first study to look at autistic people's experiences of skills in the workplace. Other studies have considered skills more generally, rather than focusing on employment—or have used other people's views about autistic skills, rather than autistic people's own views. What are potential weaknesses in the study? To take part in our study, people had to be able to fill out an online questionnaire. This can be difficult for people with intellectual impairment or other language/communication difficulties, which means that some autistic people might have been excluded from our research. More research should be done to understand the skills of people with a wider range of communication differences. Those who took part in our study were also different from the autistic population as a whole—for example, most were female and worked in education. This means that we should not presume that the strengths found in our study are shared by all autistic people. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? We think that these results could be important to employers, those working with autistic people, and autistic people themselves. By understanding the strengths that could be associated with being autistic in the workplace, autistic people may be better able to identify their own strengths in the workplace. This may enable them to find a job that they enjoy and excel at. The results should also encourage employers to make an effort to give jobs to autistic people, making changes to interview processes and working conditions, and seeking out training when needed. Overall, this study suggests that autistic people have many employment-related strengths that should be recognized and valued by autistic people and employers alike.},

  abstract = {Many healthcare systems are organised such that General Practitioners (GPs) often have a key role in identifying autism spectrum disorders (hereafter collectively referred to as autism) in children. In this review, we explored what GPs know about autism and the factors that influence their ability to identify and manage care for their patients with autism in practice. We conducted a systematic narrative review using eight electronic databases. These included Embase and MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO via Ebscohost, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) via ProQuest. Our search yielded 2,743 citations. Primary research studies were included, and we did not impose any geographical, language or date restrictions. We identified 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies included in the review were conducted between 2003 and 2019. We thematically synthesised the material and identified the following themes: the prototypical image of a child with autism; experience, sources of information, and managing care; barriers to identification; strategies to aid in identification; and characteristics that facilitate expertise. Together, the findings from this review present a mixed picture of GP knowledge and experiences in identifying autism and managing care for children with the condition. At one end of the continuum, there were GPs who had not heard of autism or endorsed outmoded aetiological theories. Others, however, demonstrated a sound knowledge of the conditions but had limited confidence in their ability to identify the condition. Many GPs and researchers alike called for more training and this might be effective. However, framing the problem as one of a lack of training risks silences the array of organisational factors that impact on a GP's ability to provide care for these patients.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communicative difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are due to bi-directional differences in communicative style and a reciprocal lack of understanding. If true, there should be increased similarity in interaction style, resulting in higher rapport during interactions between pairs of the same neurotype. Here, we provide two empirical tests of rapport, with data revealing whether self- and observer- rated rapport varies depending on the match or mismatch in autism status within a pair. An additional opportunity afforded by these data is to examine the effect of the autism status of the rater on the perceived rapport between matched and mismatched pairs. In Study 1 72 participants were allocated to one of three dyad conditions: autistic pairs ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 24), non-autistic pairs ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 24) and mixed pairs ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 12 autistic; {$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 12 non-autistic). Each participant completed three semi-structured interactions with their partner, rating rapport after each interaction. Non-autistic pairs experienced higher self-rated rapport than mixed and autistic pairs, and autistic pairs experienced higher rapport than mixed pairs. In Study 2 ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 80) autistic and non-autistic observers rated interactional rapport while watching videoed interactions between autistic pairs, non-autistic pairs, and mixed pairs ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 18, a subset of participants in Study 1). Mixed pairs were rated significantly lower on rapport than autistic and non-autistic pairs, and autistic pairs were rated more highly for rapport than non-autistic pairs. Both autistic and non-autistic observers show similar patterns in how they rate the rapport of autistic, non-autistic, and mixed pairs. In summary, autistic people experience high interactional rapport when interacting with other autistic people, and this is also detected by external observers. Rather than autistic people experiencing low rapport in all contexts, their rapport ratings are influenced by a mismatch of diagnosis. These findings suggest that autistic people possess a distinct mode of social interaction style, rather than demonstrating social skills deficits. These data are considered in terms of their implications for psychological theories of autism, as well as practical impact on educational and clinical practice.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many autistic people are motivated to have friends, relationships and close family bonds, despite the clinical characterisation of autism as a condition negatively affecting social interaction. Many first-hand accounts of autistic people describe feelings of comfort and ease specifically with other autistic people. This qualitative research explored and contrasted autistic experiences of spending social time with neurotypical and autistic friends and family. In total, 12 autistic adults (10 females, aged 21–51) completed semi-structured interviews focused on time spent with friends and family; positive and negative aspects of time spent with neurotypical and autistic friends and family; and feelings during and after spending time together. Three themes were identified: cross-neurotype understanding, minority status and belonging. Investigation of these themes reveals the benefits of autistic people creating and maintaining social relationships with other autistic people, in a more systematic way than previous individual reports. They highlight the need for autistic-led social opportunities and indicate benefits of informal peer support for autistic adults. Lay abstract Although autistic people may struggle to interact with others, many autistic people have said they find interacting with other autistic people more comfortable. To find out whether this was a common experience, we did hour-long interviews with 12 autistic adults. We asked them questions about how it feels when spending time with their friends and family, and whether it felt different depending on whether the friends and family were autistic or neurotypical. We analysed the interviews and found three common themes in what our participants said. First, they found spending with other autistic people easier and more comfortable than spending time with neurotypical people, and felt they were better understood by other autistic people. Second, autistic people often felt they were in a social minority, and in order to spend time with neurotypical friends and family, they had to conform with what the neurotypical people wanted and were used to. Third, autistic people felt like they belonged with other autistic people and that they could be themselves around them. These findings show that having time with autistic friends and family can be very beneficial for autistic people and played an important role in a happy social life.},

We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical (NT) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the NT participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the AS group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents' incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79\% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62\% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.},

  abstract = {Autistic people face high unemployment rates. One reason for this may be that hiring processes are inaccessible. This study aimed to establish autistic people's unique experiences of hiring processes in the United Kingdom, by comparing them to the experiences of non-autistic neurodivergent people and neurotypical people. Using qualitative and quantitative data from 225 autistic, 64 non-autistic neurodivergent and 88 neurotypical adults, we identified a series of (dis)similarities in participants' views and experiences of recruitment for employment. Similarities across the three groups included (1) frustration with the focus on social skills; (2) a perceived need for more flexible hiring processes; (3) a desire for more clarity and (4) the importance of the environment. Participants also acknowledged the important role employers play in one's decision to disclose a diagnosis or access need. Yet, autistic people faced a set of unique barriers to successful recruitment, over and above those that non-autistic people faced. For example, the perceived pressure to mask autistic traits to succeed and concerns about stigma and discrimination. Participants' recommendations for improvements included the use of more practical recruitment strategies (e.g. work trials), more clarity about what to expect, and improvements in recruiters' understanding of the challenges autistic and neurodivergent candidates may face.},

  abstract = {Background: A growing body of research has sought to understand autistic people's research priorities. Several of these studies have identified employment as a key research priority. Yet, there have been a few attempts to identify specific, actionable priorities within this area. Methods: Using an online survey, we asked 197 autistic people in the United Kingdom about their priorities for future autism-employment research. Results: Participants spoke of their challenges in gaining and sustaining meaningful employment and called for researchers to conduct research that results in direct improvements to employment experiences. Regarding their research priorities, participants indicated a need for research covering all aspects of the employment lifecycle from accessing employment to transitioning out of employment. Importantly, participants also discussed how such research should be conducted: with autistic people as co-researchers and ensuring a diverse range of autistic people are listened to. Conclusion: While much existing autism-employment research appears to align with the priorities outlined in this study, seemingly minimal attention has been paid to later stages of the work lifecycle (e.g., progressing into more senior job roles or transitioning out of work). By identifying disparities between autistic people's priorities and the research being conducted, we can support autistic people to drive the research agenda and ensure autism-employment research positively impacts the community it aims to serve.},

  abstract = {Background: Autistic adults receive unfavorable first impressions from typically developing (TD) adults, but these impressions improve when TD adults are made aware of their diagnosis. It remains unclear, however, how autistic adults form first impressions of other autistic adults, and whether their impressions are similarly affected by diagnostic awareness. Methods: In this study, 32 autistic and 32 TD adults viewed brief videos of 20 TD and 20 autistic adults presented either with or without their diagnostic status and rated them on character traits and their interest in interacting with them in the future. Results: Findings indicated that autistic raters shared the TD tendency to evaluate autistic adults less favorably than TD adults, but these judgments did not reduce their social interest for interacting with autistic adults as they did for TD raters. Furthermore, informing raters of the diagnostic status of autistic adults did not improve first impressions for autistic raters as they did for TD raters, suggesting that autistic raters either already inferred their autism status when no diagnosis was provided or their impression formation is less affected by awareness of a person's diagnosis. Conclusions: Collectively, these results demonstrate that autistic observers make trait inferences about autistic adults comparable with those made by TD observers—suggesting a similar sensitivity to perceiving and interpreting social signifiers that differ between TD and autistic presentation styles—but unlike their TD counterparts, these trait judgments are not perceived as an impediment to subsequent social interaction and are relatively consistent regardless of diagnostic disclosure. Lay summary Why was this study done? Typically developing (TD) adults often form negative first impressions of autistic adults and report less of a desire to interact with them. These biases affect the social experiences of autistic adults and can contribute to their social disability. More optimistically, however, first impressions of autistic adults improve when TD adults are more knowledgeable about autism and are made aware of their diagnostic status, suggesting that familiarity and understanding can promote acceptance of autistic differences. One group that has high familiarity with autism is autistic adults themselves, but no study to date has examined how autistic adults form impressions of TD adults and other autistic adults. What was the purpose of this study? The purpose of this study was to examine whether first impressions of, and social interest in, autistic adults differ between autistic and TD raters, and determine whether disclosure of a person's diagnosis affects these patterns differently for autistic and TD raters. What did the researchers do? A total of 32 TD and 32 autistic adult raters viewed videos of 40 unfamiliar adults (20 TD and 20 autistic individuals) and rated each person on six traits (awkwardness, attractiveness, assertiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, and intelligence) and four items assessing their social interest in future interaction with the person in the video. Videos were presented either with or without the person's diagnosis to see whether this information affects impressions formed by autistic and TD raters. What were the results of the study? Consistent with prior work, TD raters formed more negative first impressions of autistic adults than TD adults. Meanwhile, autistic raters formed more positive impressions overall, but shared the TD pattern of rating autistic adults less favorably than TD adults on several traits. However, contrary to theories about reduced social motivation in autism, autistic raters expressed greater interest than TD raters in future interaction with people in the videos and this social interest was largest for other autistic people. Finally, diagnostic disclosure improved impressions of autistic adults made by TD raters but not by autistic raters. What do these findings add to what was already known? These findings provide empirical evidence that autistic adults detect and interpret autistic social differences similarly to TD adults, but they express greater inclusivity and less discriminatory attitudes about these differences. These results add to a growing literature about how autistic people are perceived, how these perceptions affect their social experiences, and how similarity between social partners can support social connection. What are potential weaknesses in the study? The included sample was predominantly Caucasian and male, and did not include participants with intellectual disability. Future studies should examine whether the patterns here extend to more diverse samples. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? This study provides additional evidence that social opportunities for autistic adults are affected by the perceptions and biases of potential social partners. Autistic observers may share the TD bias toward less favorable trait evaluation of autistic adults, but this did not lessen their social interest in interacting with autistic adults the way it did for TD observers. Opportunities for autistic adults to interact with other autistic adults may facilitate relationship development in this population who often struggle to have their social needs met. In addition, findings suggest that acceptance of autistic people increases with familiarity of autism itself. Improving attitudes about autism among TD people may be one effective way to improve the social experiences of autistic people within neurotypical environments.},

  abstract = {Background: Emerging research suggests that seeking an autism diagnosis as an adult is usually difficult and time-consuming but brings relief once a diagnosis is made. This study explored the experience of the pathway to an autism diagnosis during adulthood for adults living in Australia. Methods: We conducted a qualitative phenomenological study and interviewed 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to autism diagnosis in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed by using a thematic approach. Results: Data analysis resulted in 6 themes and 20 meaning units that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two interwoven journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic, whereas the clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports. Conclusions: Given the potential benefits for adults obtaining a formal autism diagnosis and accessing post-diagnostic supports, it is important that health professionals and governments collaborate to reduce access barriers and ensure adequate services are available. The findings from this study informed the development of Australia's national guideline for autism diagnosis. Community brief Why is this an important issue? The experience of being diagnosed as autistic as an adult is not well understood, particularly in Australia. Research from other places, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, suggests that receiving an autism diagnosis in adulthood is difficult and time-consuming, but brings relief. We do not know whether this is the same for adults in Australia. What was the purpose of this study? This study aimed at exploring the experience of seeking an autism diagnosis during adulthood in Australia. What did the researchers do? We conducted interviews with 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to an autism diagnosis. Three sets of interview questions were used, depending on whether they had already obtained an autism diagnosis, were going through the assessment process, or were self-diagnosed. Adults completed the interview in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed word-for-word, and the transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes. What were the results of the study? We identified six themes that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two related journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic. The clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports. Before starting the diagnostic process in adulthood, participants described always feeling different and many missed opportunities to receive an autism diagnosis in their younger years. During the diagnostic process, participants described beginning to consider whether they were autistic and the varied pathways they underwent to confirm this. After the diagnostic process, participants described their experiences of living as autistic and a lack of post-diagnostic supports tailored to their needs. What do these findings add to what was already known? Our findings were similar to previous research findings from other countries, including the complex journey to diagnosis, relief and understanding on identifying as autistic, and lack of post-diagnostic services. However, to our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. Further, we included participants who did not have a formal diagnosis of autism. This group of people is often excluded from autism research, and their experiences of seeking an autism diagnosis are largely unknown. What are potential weaknesses in the study? The weaknesses of our study included recruiting a relatively small sample of mostly Caucasian females, and we did not consult with our study participants or other autistic adults to see whether our final themes aligned well with their experience. However, no new findings emerged in later interviews and our findings were similar to international literature. Future research should recruit more diverse groups of autistic adults and involve greater levels of autistic input. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? Our findings informed the development of the “National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Australia,” a first step toward improving autism diagnosis in Australia.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by challenges in social communication and the presence of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Notably, males are four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with autism. Despite efforts to increase representation and characterization of autistic females, research studies consistently enroll small samples of females, or exclude females altogether. Importantly, researchers often rely on standardized measures to confirm diagnosis prior to enrollment in research studies. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of one such measure (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS) on research inclusion/exclusion rates by sex in autistic adults, all of whom had a preexisting community diagnosis of autism (n = 145, 95 male, 50 female). Using the ADOS as a confirmatory diagnostic measure resulted in the exclusion of autistic females at a rate over 2.5 times higher than that of autistic males. We compared sex ratios in our sample to those in other large, publically available datasets that rely either on community diagnosis (6 datasets, total n = 42,209) or standardized assessments (2 datasets, total n = 214) to determine eligibility of participants for research. Reliance on community diagnosis rather than confirmatory diagnostic assessments resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios. These results provide evidence for a “leaky” recruitment-to-research pipeline for females in autism research. Lay Summary Despite efforts to increase the representation of autistic females in research, studies consistently enroll small samples of females or exclude females altogether. We find that despite making up almost 50\% of the initially recruited sample based upon self-report of community diagnosis, autistic females are disproportonately excluded from research participation as a result of commonly used autism diagnostic measures. In our sample, and several other publically available datasets, reliance on community diagnosis resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios.},

The RCGP continues to promote proper care of autistic patients, their families, and carers. In its position statement on the subject in June 20162 it recognised the essential role general practice plays in caring for this community, their families, and carers. It committed to promoting evidence-based training on autism, and to sign-posting resources that enable equitable access by this group to primary health care.

Much remains to be done, and although sensitivities to the needs of autistic patients have improved, the experience and needs of autistic doctors have gone, largely, unrecognised. Recent prevalence data indicates 1.1\% of the UK population is autistic,4 although this is widely held to be an underestimate.

  abstract = {Objectives Autistic people experience poor physical and mental health along with reduced life expectancy compared with non-autistic people. Our aim was to identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by autistic adults compared with non-autistic adults and to link these barriers to self-reported adverse health consequences. Design Following consultation with the autistic community at an autistic conference, Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered online through social media platforms. Setting A 52-item, international, online survey. Participants 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic adults. Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported barriers to accessing healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes. Results Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37\% of non-autistic respondents reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner (GP). The highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a GP visit (72\%), difficulty making appointments by telephone (62\%), not feeling understood (56\%), difficulty communicating with their doctor (53\%) and the waiting room environment (51\%). Autistic adults reported a preference for online or text-based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, the first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults were associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes included untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery due to late presentations and untreated potentially life-threatening conditions. There were no significant differences in difficulty attending, barriers experienced or adverse outcomes between formally diagnosed and self-identified autistic respondents. Conclusions Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication needs and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs are as necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.},

  abstract = {Despite the high prevalence of co-occurring autism spectrum disorders and mental health condition(s), there exist substantial barriers to mental health treatment for autistic individuals. These barriers are exacerbated by a lack of mental health provider training and self-efficacy in providing adapted services to autistic individuals. One method which has been effective in mitigating similar service gaps is the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO) Autism model, a tele-mentoring platform that connects primary care physicians to autism spectrum disorder experts to improve physicians’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and practice. This study developed and implemented a pilot mental health version of Project ECHO Autism designed to increase mental health provider knowledge, self-efficacy, and problem-solving. Community mental health providers (N\,=\,51) participated in the 6-month Project ECHO Autism including mental health–focused didactics and provider case presentations. Analysis of pre- and post-measures revealed improvements in all domains, including significant increases in provider knowledge of autism spectrum disorders, self-efficacy, and problem-solving. Participants additionally reported high satisfaction with their experience. Taken together, preliminary results indicate that Project ECHO Autism may be a feasible, accessible, and effective method for increasing mental health provider competence and ultimately increasing access to services for autistic individuals who have co-occurring mental health diagnoses. Lay abstract Although many autistic individuals have additional mental health conditions, most have a hard time getting services from mental health providers. One reason why these services can be hard to access is that many mental health providers do not feel confident in their ability to provide services to autistic individuals. To share autism expertise with local community providers and boost their confidence in working with autistic individuals, we created a mental health version of the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO) Autism virtual teleconsultation program. In this pilot study, we recruited 51 community mental health providers to participate in Project ECHO Autism. During each biweekly session, providers received information from autism experts about how to tailor mental health interventions (e.g. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or anxiety interventions) for use with autistic individuals. They also had the opportunity to ask questions and get advice on their current cases. At the end of the 6-month study, mental health providers showed improvements in their confidence, in their knowledge of autism, and in their problem-solving skills. Nearly half (45\%) of these providers participated from rural counties, suggesting that the Project ECHO Autism teleconsultation model was able to reach mental health providers who might not have been able to get training otherwise. This study supports the feasibility of using Project ECHO Autism to share autism knowledge with mental health providers, consequently expanding mental health service options for autistic individuals with co-occurring mental health conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by highly individualized neuroanatomical deviations that potentially map onto distinct genotypes and clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to link differences in brain anatomy to specific biological pathways to pave the way toward targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods: The authors examined neurodevelopmental differences in cortical thickness and their genomic underpinnings in a large and clinically diverse sample of 360 individuals with ASD and 279 typically developing control subjects (ages 6–30 years) within the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). The authors also examined neurodevelopmental differences and their potential pathophysiological mechanisms between clinical ASD subgroups that differed in the severity and pattern of sensory features. Results: In addition to significant between-group differences in “core” ASD brain regions (i.e., fronto-temporal and cingulate regions), individuals with ASD manifested as neuroanatomical outliers within the neurotypical cortical thickness range in a wider neural system, which was enriched for genes known to be implicated in ASD on the genetic and/or transcriptomic level. Within these regions, the individuals’ total (i.e., accumulated) degree of neuroanatomical atypicality was significantly correlated with higher polygenic scores for ASD and other psychiatric conditions, and it scaled with measures of symptom severity. Differences in cortical thickness deviations were also associated with distinct sensory subgroups, especially in brain regions expressing genes involved in excitatory rather than inhibitory neurotransmission. Conclusions: The study findings corroborate the link between macroscopic differences in brain anatomy and the molecular mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in ASD, and provide future targets for stratification and subtyping.},

Improved understanding and guidance addressing these needs will allow pediatric and adult providers to work together to optimize social, medical, and occupational outcomes for these patients. Recent findings  Health-care transition is a delicate time when children with ASD outgrow the services of pediatric programs and enter a fragmented healthcare system that is unfamiliar, insufficiently knowledgeable, and underfunded for their needs. Summary  Increasing autism prevalence and an aging population with autism lend urgency to improve outcomes in children transitioning to adult-care. Research reveals poor consequences in social support, education, vocational training and employment, housing, and healthcare. Specific considerations to address these issues and ensure successful transition from pediatric to adult care are needed.},

The first part of the article explores how ‘autism’ was used as a category to describe hallucinations and unconscious fantasy life in infants through the work of significant child psychologists and psychoanalysts such as Jean Piaget, Lauretta Bender, Leo Kanner and Elwyn James Anthony. Theories of autism were then associated both with schizophrenia in adults and with psychoanalytic styles of reasoning. The closure of institutions for ‘mental defectives’ and the growth in speech therapy services in the 1960s and 1970s encouraged new models for understanding autism in infants and children. The second half of the article explores how researchers such as Victor Lotter and Michael Rutter used the category of autism to reconceptualize psychological development in infants and children via epidemiological studies. These historical changes have influenced the form and function of later research into autism and related conditions.},

Ensuring that appropriate support structures are in place is imperative for their academic, social, and personal success. However, research on students with ASD often does not include student perspectives. Mismanagement of students' transition into higher education institutions, coupled with a general lack of knowledge regarding their unique needs, can lead to anxiety, stigmatisation, bullying, and poor performance. The objective of this cross-sectional mixed-methods study was to explore the academic, social, institutional, and environmental challenges of students with ASD. Convenience sampling resulted in a sample of 74 students enrolled at a large, urban research university in the southeastern United States. Findings revealed significant differences between gender and use of support services, diagnosis disclosure, social engagement, and difficulties interacting with neurotypical people in an environment often perceived as ill-equipped to provide support. Consequently, potential institutional, programmatic, and policy implications emerged.},

  abstract = {Autistic children grow to become autistic adults, and autism is increasingly diagnosed in adulthood and later life. This qualitative study aimed to understand experiences of autism throughout adulthood. A national cohort study of autistic adults and relatives of autistic adults (ASC-UK), enabled purposive recruitment of a diverse sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 autistic adults (aged 20–71 years), mostly diagnosed in adulthood, and 16 relatives (aged 31–81 years) of autistic adults diagnosed across both childhood and adulthood (including some with learning disability). Interview topics included health, relationships, education, employment, quality of life and everyday experiences. Thematic analysis of the accounts of the autistic adults identified six key themes relating to their experiences: (1) diagnosis as validating yet limiting; (2) supportive and non-supportive social agents; (3) the “invisibility” of the needs of autistic adults; (4) health in the context of autism; (5) staying `outside' the circle; and (6) multiple lives with autism. Data from relatives about autistic adult experiences gave additional perspectives on these themes. Experiences reported in other studies–of `difference' from others, challenges of social engagement, and learning to `conform' to society's expectations–were evident and relevant to male and female autistic adults, across all age groups, and unrelated to stage of life when diagnosed. Some expressed disappointment with their lives, but others were proud of their achievements. Education and employment, whilst challenging for many, were also rewarding for some. Health care and social services were often experienced as inaccessible, inappropriate, or lacking understanding of the individual's needs. We conclude that greater public understanding of autism as experienced in adulthood is needed. Key priorities are improving the availability of `appropriate' health and social care services for autistic adults and families, and providing practical support to enable enhanced participation in life.},

The ASD/PSY group showed a higher percentage of males, they were older and showed lower adaptive skills than the group with ASD; moreover, their mothers exhibited higher stress levels than mothers of participants in the ASD group. The comparison between age groups in participants within ASD/PSY group revealed that preschoolers had lower IQ than school-age children and adolescents, and worse adaptive skills, more repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests than adolescents.

However, little is presently known about the demographics of gender-identity issues in autism spectrum disorder.

We surveyed gender-dysphoria with the Gender-Identity/Gender-Dysphoria Questionnaire among 90 males and 219 females with autism spectrum disorder and compared these rates to those of 103 males and 158 females without autism spectrum disorder. When compared to typically developing individuals, autistic individuals reported a higher number of gender-dysphoric traits. Rates of gender-dysphoria in the group with autism spectrum disorder were significantly higher than reported in the wider population. Mediation analysis found that the relationship between autistic traits and sexual orientation was mediated by gender-dysphoric traits. Results suggest that autism spectrum disorder presents a unique experience to the formation and consolidation of gender identity, and for some autistic individuals, their sexual orientation relates to their gender experience. It is important that clinicians working with autism spectrum disorder are aware of the gender-diversity in this population so that the necessary support for healthy socio-sexual functioning and mental well-being is provided.},

  abstract = {Introduction Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) develop early in life and are thought to last a lifetime. However, ASC research has two major knowledge gaps that hinder progression in understanding the concept of ASC and in providing proper support for autistic adults: (1) the majority of knowledge about ASC mainly stems from childhood studies so little is known about older autistic adults and (2) while it is broadly recognised that ASC is a heterogeneous condition, we do not yet understand the differences in trajectories leading to their future outcome. We aim to fill both knowledge gaps. Methods and analysis A multistage overlapping cohort design assessing (cognitive) ageing in ASC is designed to obtain an accelerated longitudinal data set. Data, including a multitude of questionnaires, diagnostics and cognitive tests, are collected over four waves within a 10-year time frame. This will provide information regarding actual changes in quality of life, co-occurring health conditions and cognition as well as the possibility to test external validity and temporal stability in newly formed behavioural subtypes. Participants consist of three groups of adults aged 20–90 years: (1) with a clinical diagnosis of ASC, (2) with a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but no ASC, (3) no ASC/ADHD (ie, comparison group). The sample size differs between waves and instruments. Detailed analysis plans will be preregistered in AsPredicted or at the Open Science Framework.

  abstract = {Autistic and non-autistic adults' agreement with scientific knowledge about autism, how they define autism, and their endorsement of stigmatizing conceptions of autism has not previously been examined. Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism, including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model. Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma. Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as partners in autism research.},

  abstract = {Autism is often viewed as an impairment, preventing Autistic individuals from achieving success in the world. We argue that, Autism can be an enhancement, particularly in some professional contexts, including qualitative research. However, Autistic people experience higher rates of unemployment and underemployment (lower skills/part-time). The social model of neurodiversity highlights the role of inaccessible workplaces and practices. Alongside this, the concept of the `Autistic Advantage', a strengths-based model, emphasises the ways in which Autistic people are assets to the social structures in which they exist. Two late diagnosed Autistic women, acknowledged as qualitative research experts, review the literature on Disability, neurodiversity and research; outline their own professional strengths; discuss their professional strengths in the light of the literature; and make recommendations for Autistic researchers and their neurotypical colleagues. Autistic qualities and preferences can be strengths in qualitative research teams. This includes long periods of concentration (hyperfocus), leading to `flow' and creative thinking, attention to detail, and detailed knowledge of topic areas that are of interest to the individual. We conclude that qualitative research teams can benefit from working inclusively with Autistic researchers. We present guidance to facilitate inclusive working, without which Autistic researchers may be Disabled by their work environment},

  abstract = {Erving Goffman's 1963 foundational discussion of stigma has been both embraced and critiqued in disability studies and other fields. In Goffman's interactional and ahistorical analysis, stigma was presumed to exist as a natural feature of humanity, deflecting attention away from historical analysis. This article, in contrast, argues that stigma—particularly surrounding “mental illness”—is deeply embedded in historically contingent structural conditions of modern capitalism and ideologies of individualism that shape ideals of the modern worker. Specifically, I use the case of autism—and its commodification in the United States—to show how a stigmatized “mental illness” is intertwined with a range of financial interests that come to depend on the continued production of certain diagnoses. For example, an analysis of the “autism industrial complex” in the United States reveals how economic changes set the conditions for a range of practices that promise to reduce stigma; these include special education, activism/advocacy, and self-representation. These occur in the context of a transition toward more flexible employment and the increasing value of technological and artistic skills often associated with neurodiversity. Despite the fact that a capitalist logic continues to define valuations of personhood, families and autistic self-advocates have been empowered in recent years to use a variety of strategies to decouple stigma and illness and resist conventional definitions of autism as a syndrome of deficits.},

Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.},

  abstract = {Autism can be understood as a concealable stigmatised identity. This is the first systematic review to synthesise the literature on autistic people's experiences of stigma and coping strategies. 2877 studies were screened and 27 were included in this review. The reviewed literature demonstrates that autistic individuals are acutely aware of being stereotyped, judged, and discriminated by others. Autistic people also show signs of internalising stigma, rendering them more vulnerable to low self-worth and poorer mental health. To manage the impact of stigma, the included studies suggest that autistic individuals may use these strategies: concealment and camouflaging, selective disclosure and self-advocacy, as well as positive reframing and reconstructing identity. However, the evidence is limited and mixed in terms of how helpful and effective these strategies are. Future studies should include autistic populations with a wider range of intellectual abilities and explore interventions that can support autistic people in managing stigma to supplement interventions that seek to reduce stigma towards autistic people. The power of language in perpetuating and challenging stigma also has important implications for research and practice, underscoring the need for researchers and practitioners to reflect carefully on the messages they are communicating about autism. Lay summaryThis review has found that autistic people often experience stigma, which refers to negative attitudes and treatment from others. Because of that, some autistic people also have negative beliefs about themselves, which may affect their self-worth and mental health.While research suggests that autistic people use a range of strategies to manage stigma, the evidence is limited and mixed in terms of how helpful these strategies are.},

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the continuity of care of autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the Center for Autism Services and Transition (CAST), to propensity score matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. The unadjusted median Bice–Boxerman continuity of care index was 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for CAST patients, 0.5 (interquartile range = 0.3–1.0) for Medicare beneficiaries, and 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for privately insured autistic adults. In multivariable models controlling for demographic characteristics, on average, CAST patients had continuity of care indices that were 10\% higher than national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries (p {$<$} 0.0001). Continuity of care among CAST patients did not significantly differ from that of the national sample of privately insured autistic adults (p = 0.08). Our findings suggest that medical homes, like CAST, may be a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults. Lay abstract There is a nationally recognized need for innovative healthcare delivery models to improve care continuity for autistic adults as they age out of pediatric and into adult healthcare systems. One possible model of care delivery is called the “medical home”. The medical home is not a residential home, but a system where a patient's healthcare is coordinated through a primary care physician to ensure necessary care is received when and where the patient needs it. We compared the continuity of care among autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the CAST, to matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. Continuity of primary care among CAST patients was significantly better than that of matched national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries and similar to that of privately insured autistic adults. Our findings suggest that medical homes, like CAST, are a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults.},

Taking a rather personal retrospective, reflecting on our own time in autism research, this review explores changes in the concept of autism and the implications of these for future research. We focus on seven major changes in how autism is thought of, operationalised, and recognised: (1) from a narrow definition to wide diagnostic criteria; (2) from a rare to a relatively common condition, although probably still under-recognised in women; (3) from something affecting children, to a lifelong condition; (4) from something discreet and distinct, to a dimensional view; (5) from one thing to many `autisms', and a compound or `fractionable' condition; (6) from a focus on `pure' autism, to recognition that complexity and comorbidity is the norm; and finally, (7) from conceptualising autism purely as a `developmental disorder', to recognising a neurodiversity perspective, operationalised in participatory research models. We conclude with some challenges for the field and suggestions for areas currently neglected in autism research.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by early childhood-onset impairments in communication and social interaction alongside restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. This review summarizes recent developments in human genetics research in autism, complemented by epigenetic and transcriptomic findings. The clinical heterogeneity of autism is mirrored by a complex genetic architecture involving several types of common and rare variants, ranging from point mutations to large copy number variants, and either inherited or spontaneous (de novo). More than 100 risk genes have been implicated by rare, often de novo, potentially damaging mutations in highly constrained genes. These account for substantial individual risk but a small proportion of the population risk. In contrast, most of the genetic risk is attributable to common inherited variants acting en masse, each individually with small effects. Studies have identified a handful of robustly associated common variants. Different risk genes converge on the same mechanisms, such as gene regulation and synaptic connectivity. These mechanisms are also implicated by genes that are epigenetically and transcriptionally dysregulated in autism. Major challenges to understanding the biological mechanisms include substantial phenotypic heterogeneity, large locus heterogeneity, variable penetrance, and widespread pleiotropy. Considerable increases in sample sizes are needed to better understand the hundreds or thousands of common and rare genetic variants involved. Future research should integrate common and rare variant research, multi-omics data including genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, and refined phenotype assessment with multidimensional and longitudinal measures.},

  abstract = {Many of the nearly six million autistic adolescents and adults in the United States require support to navigate daily life. Family members often provide the first line of support for autistic youth by providing care and coordinating services. Although considerable research has examined the perspectives of family members caring for young autistic children, comparatively less has focused on those caring for transition-age youth who often struggle to access needed services as they leave child-serving systems of care. This study examined caregiver-reported barriers to service for 174 adolescents and young adults on the spectrum (ages 16–30) and the association between such barriers and unmet service needs. Exploratory factor analysis suggested two service barrier domains: access (e.g., cost) and quality (e.g., providers not trained). Regression models indicated that caregivers whose youth were diagnosed at older ages perceived both greater access and quality barriers. Male caregivers reported fewer access barriers, and those who perceived greater caregiver burdens (daily life disruptions, financial difficulties, and worries) reported more access barriers. Caregivers whose youth lived with them reported fewer quality barriers. Greater access–but not quality–service barriers predicted greater unmet service needs. Findings have implications for service delivery to autistic youth and specific directions for future research. Lay Abstract Prior studies have described the roadblocks, or barriers, to needed services experienced by families with young autistic children, but less research has focused on those faced by autistic adolescents and young adults. In this study, we wished to understand the barriers to service experienced by autistic adolescents and young adults and their families. We surveyed 174 caregivers of autistic youth between 16 to 30\,years old. We found that caregivers who felt more caregiving burden had more difficulty accessing services for their youth. Specifically, caregivers who felt more strongly that their daily lives had been disrupted, felt more financial strain, and worried more about their youth well-being experienced more roadblocks to getting services for the youth. Male caregivers also reported fewer difficulties related to service access. Importantly, the older the youth was when they had been diagnosed with autism, the more service barriers their caregivers reported. We did not see any differences in the level of barriers experienced by youth who lived in urban versus suburban settings, or between white and non-white families. However, when youth lived with their caregivers (rather than, for example, in a group home), fewer quality-related barriers to services were reported. Finally, greater access (but not quality) barriers were linked to youth having more unmet service needs. These findings can help to reduce the barriers to service experienced by autistic adolescents and young adults and their families.},

  abstract = {Adult autism studies are increasingly comprised of later-diagnosed adults, yet little is known about how these adults compare to those diagnosed earlier in life. The present study examines medical and psychiatric conditions endorsed by autistic adults and documents differences between those diagnosed with ASD in childhood versus adulthood, as well as across age groups and sex at birth. 4657 legally independent adults (ages 18–85, M = 33.4 years) with professional ASD diagnoses who completed a medical questionnaire were drawn from the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK) study. Chi square analyses, t-tests, and logistic regressions were used to compare medical and psychiatric conditions between age groups, sex at birth and adults diagnosed in childhood (before age 21) versus adulthood (at or after 21 years). Overall number of conditions endorsed as being diagnosed by a professional was high, with an average of 1.69 (SD = 2.01) medical or developmental and 2.98 (SD = 2.29) psychiatric conditions reported across the sample. Females were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions (OR = 1.68). Adult-diagnosed adults were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions (OR = 2.71) and reported more lifetime psychiatric diagnoses (M = 3.15, SD = 2.23) than their childhood-diagnosed counterparts (M = 2.81, SD = 2.33). These findings underscore the need for research to better understand and treat co-occurring psychiatric conditions in autistic adults and report and consider the age of diagnosis in adult autism samples. Moreover, results suggest it is imperative that mental health professionals receive autism training to promote accurate differential diagnosis and equitable access to mental health care for autistic adults with co-occurring psychiatric conditions.},

  abstract = {Autistic people who cannot speak risk being underestimated. Their inability to speak, along with other unconventional behaviors and mannerisms, can give rise to limiting assumptions about their capacities, including their capacity to acquire literacy. In this preregistered study, we developed a task to investigate whether autistic adolescents and adults with limited or no phrase speech (N\,=\,31) have learned English orthographic conventions. Participants played a game that involved tapping sequentially pulsing targets on an iPad as quickly as they could. Three patterns in their response times suggest they know how to spell: (a) They were faster to tap letters of the alphabet that pulsed in sequences that spelled sentences than letters or nonsense symbols that pulsed in closely matched but meaningless sequences; (b) they responded more quickly to pairs of letters in meaningful sequences the more often the letters co-occur in English; and (c) they spontaneously paused before tapping the first pulsing letter of a new word. These findings suggest that nonspeaking autistic people can acquire foundational literacy skills. With appropriate instruction and support, it might be possible to harness these skills to provide nonspeaking autistic people access to written forms of communication as an alternative to speech. Lay abstract Many autistic people who do not talk cannot tell other people what they know or what they are thinking. As a result, they might not be able to go to the schools they want, share feelings with friends, or get jobs they like. It might be possible to teach them to type on a computer or tablet instead of talking. But first, they would have to know how to spell. Some people do not believe that nonspeaking autistic people can learn to spell. We did a study to see if they can. We tested 31 autistic teenagers and adults who do not talk much or at all. They played a game on an iPad where they had to tap flashing letters. After they played the game, we looked at how fast they tapped the letters. They did three things that people who know how to spell would do. First, they tapped flashing letters faster when the letters spelled out sentences than when the letters made no sense. Second, they tapped letters that usually go together faster than letters that do not usually go together. This shows that they knew some spelling rules. Third, they paused before tapping the first letter of a new word. This shows that they knew where one word ended and the next word began. These results suggest that many autistic people who do not talk can learn how to spell. If they are given appropriate opportunities, they might be able to learn to communicate by typing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}As autism has gained increased attention in the past few decades, autistic advocates have adopted the phrase “Nothing about us without us,” illustrating the idea that autistic people should be centered in all conversations regarding autism. However, in a large portion of autism research, autistic people are still not meaningfully engaged throughout the research process, leading to continued stigma in research through biased methods. Thus, stigma about autism influences not only the content of autism research, but the ways in which neurotypical people conduct research alongside (or without) autistic people, ultimately resulting in less valid conclusions or research that actively harms the autistic community. One way to address this stigma is through involving autistic individuals as equal partners in the research process, such as by including autistic co-interviewers in qualitative studies of autistic people. In this perspectives piece, we will highlight the benefits of participatory research practices within qualitative research. Furthermore, we will outline methods for conducting co-interviews with autistic research partners and share insights from our experiences implementing this practice. We hope this piece provides researchers the practical resources and inspiration to continue working toward decreasing the stigma surrounding autism in research spaces.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using an online survey, we examined the perceived opposition between the medical model and the neurodiversity movement by assessing conceptions of autism and neurodiversity among people with different relations to autism. Participants (N = 657) included autistic people, relatives and friends of autistic people, and people with no specified relation to autism. Self-identification as autistic and neurodiversity awareness were associated with viewing autism as a positive identity that needs no cure, suggesting core differences between the medical model and the neurodiversity movement. Nevertheless, results suggested substantial overlap between these approaches to autism. Recognition of the negative aspects of autism and endorsement of parenting practices that celebrate and ameliorate but do not eliminate autism did not differ based on relation to autism or awareness of neurodiversity. These findings suggest a deficit-as-difference conception of autism wherein neurological conditions may represent equally valid pathways within human diversity. Potential areas of common ground in research and practice regarding autism are discussed.},

Methods Databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, Autism Data, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Current Controlled Trials) were searched for published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia in children with autism spectrum conditions. Results Three studies met the inclusion criteria, one provided actigraphy data, one Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) data, and one both actigraphy and CSHQ data for use in meta-analyses. There were significant differences between the behavioural intervention and comparison groups (actigraphy data) for total sleep time (24.41 minutes, 95\% CI 5.71, 43.11, P = 0.01), sleep latency (-18.31 minutes, 95\% CI -30.84, -5.77, P = 0.004) and sleep efficiency (5.59\%, 95\% CI 0.87, 10.31, P = 0.02). There was also a favourable intervention effect evident for the subjective CSHQ data (-4.71, 95\% CI -6.70, -2.73, P{$<$}0.00001).

This study sought to describe the frequency and distribution of comorbidit conditions in individuals with ASD, and systematically evaluate the possibility that pre- and postnatal exposures (e.g., preterm birth, hypoxia at birth, traumatic brain injury, and fetal alcohol syndrome) associated with ASD may also be linked with distinct comorbidities. We used the SPARK study database, launched by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI). Comorbidities considered in the study included neurological, cognitive, psychiatric, and physical conditions. The study sample consisted of 42,569 individuals with ASD and their 11,389 non-ASD siblings (full and half siblings). Majority (74\%) of individuals with ASD had at least one comorbidity, and had a greater average number of comorbidities than their non-ASD siblings. Preterm birth and hypoxia at birth were the most common peri-natal exposures in the sample. In logistic regression models adjusted for covariates, these exposures were associated with several distinct comorbidities in ASD cases, including attention and behavior problems, psychiatric and neurological disorders, and growth conditions. A similar pattern of association was also observed in non-ASD siblings. Our findings underscore that individuals with ASD experience a greater burden of comorbidities, which could be partly attributable to the higher rates of perinatal exposures compared to their non-ASD siblings. Study findings, if replicated in other samples, can inform the etiology of comorbidity in ASD.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum conditions comprise a set of early-onset neurodevelopmental syndromes with a prevalence of 1\% across all ages. First diagnosis in adulthood has finally become recognised as an important clinical issue due to the increasing awareness of autism, broadening of diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of the spectrum concept. Thus, the idea of a lost generation of people who were previously excluded from a diagnosis of classic autism has arisen. Making a first diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions in adults can be challenging for practical reasons (eg, no person to provide a developmental history), developmental reasons (eg, the acquisition of learnt or camouflaging strategies), and clinical reasons (eg, high frequency of co-occurring disorders). The diagnostic process includes referral, screening, interviews with informants and patients, and functional assessments. In delineating differential diagnoses, true comorbidities, and overlapping behaviour with other psychiatric diagnoses, particular attention should be paid to anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, personality disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Possible misdiagnosis, especially in women, should be explored. The creation of supportive, accepting, and autism-friendly social and physical environments is important and requires a coordinated effort across agencies and needs support from government policies.},

  abstract = {The present longitudinal study investigated changes in service receipt and unmet service needs spanning 14 years before and after high school exit in a large community-based sample of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 204), of whom 59\% had co-occurring intellectual disability (ID). Using multilevel models, potential discontinuity of service patterns at the point of high school exit was examined, as well as the rate of change in services received and needed during the high school years and into the post-high school period. Differences between those with and without ID were probed. Study findings indicated that overall, sample members experienced a reduction in receipt of services during high school, particularly for those without co-occurring ID. After high school exit, sample members experienced a decline in services received; for those without ID, there was a continuous rate of loss of services after leaving high school but for those with ID, there was a sharp decline in services received. Unmet service needs increased right after high school exit for both those with and without ID. These patterns reflect loss of entitlement for services that accompanies high school exit, and the limited availability of adult services for individuals with ASD. This study documented not only the post-high school service cliff that has been the subject of much concern, but also that the loss of services begins long before high school exit and that subgroups of the population with ASD are particularly vulnerable.

Lay Summary In this research, we studied changes in the number of services received before and after high school exit in a large sample of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). With each passing year during high school, individuals with ASD received fewer services. At the time of high school exit, there was a sharp drop in the number of services received, particularly for those with co-occurring intellectual disability. This study found not only that there is a post-high school service cliff, but also that the loss of services begins long before high school exit.},

These debates have had genuine impact within some areas of autism research but their influence is less evident within early intervention research. In this paper, we argue that all autism intervention stakeholders need to understand and actively engage with the views of autistic people and with neurodiversity as a concept and movement. In so doing, intervention researchers and practitioners are required to move away from a normative agenda and pay diligence to environmental goodness-of-fit, autistic developmental trajectories, internal drivers and experiences, and autistic prioritized intervention targets. Autism intervention researchers must respond to these debates by reframing effectiveness, developing tools to measure autistic prioritized outcomes, and forming partnerships with autistic people. There is a pressing need for increased reflection and articulation around how intervention practices align with a neurodiversity framework and greater emphasis within intervention programmes on natural developmental processes, coping strategies, autonomy, and well-being.},

However, little is known about the long-term impact of strengths-based approaches. This study aimed to explore the long-term outcomes of community strengths-based programs designed to support autistic adolescents in developing interests and skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) and the factors influencing their participation in these programs. A repeated cross-sectional survey study over three years recruited 52 parents in 2018, 52 parents in 2019, and 38 parents in 2020. Results highlighted the positive impact of these programs on autistic adolescents’ health and well-being, social relationships and interactions, self-confidence and self-esteem, sense of belonging, and activities and participation. Five key elements influencing participation included the enthusiasm of the participants, their self-perception, the approach of the programs, the learning environment, and the attitudes of the mentors. This study implies that strengths-based approaches to intervention and support for autistic adolescents in a supported environment are a social model solution that could potentially have positive participant outcomes. Findings from this study could provide a framework underpinning future strengths-based interventions.},

  abstract = {The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) controversially combined previously distinct subcategories of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) into a single diagnostic category. However, genetic convergences and divergences between different ASD subcategories are unclear. By retrieving 1725 exonic de novo mutations (DNMs) from 1628 subjects with autistic disorder (AD), 1873 from 1564 subjects with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), 276 from 247 subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS), and 2077 from 2299 controls, we found that rates of putative functional DNMs (loss-of-function, predicted deleterious missense, and frameshift) in all three subcategories were significantly higher than those in control. We then investigated the convergences and divergences of the three ASD subcategories based on four genetic aspects: whether any two ASD subcategories (1) shared significantly more genes with functional DNMs, (2) exhibited similar spatio-temporal expression patterns, (3) shared significantly more candidate genes, and (4) shared some ASD-associated functional pathways. It is revealed that AD and PDD-NOS were broadly convergent in terms of all four genetic aspects, suggesting these two ASD subcategories may be genetically combined. AS was divergent to AD and PDD-NOS for aspects of functional DNMs and expression patterns, whereas AS and AD/PDD-NOS were convergent for aspects of candidate genes and functional pathways. Our results indicated that the three ASD subcategories present more genetic convergences than divergences, favouring DSM-5's new classification. This study suggests that specifically defined genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes should be integrated analyzed for precise diagnosis of complex disorders, such as ASD.},

  abstract = {Autistic people are often portrayed as lacking empathy. Yet they are not indifferent to others’ feelings. To advance our understanding of the early development of empathy in autistic children, this longitudinal study followed the development of four empathy abilities: emotion contagion, attention to others, emotion acknowledgment, and prosocial actions, in 1- to 6-year-old autistic children (N\,=\,61; Mage\,=\,55.49\,months), in comparison with non-autistic peers (N\,=\,145; Mage\,=\,52.16\,months). Once a year, for 4 consecutive years, children’s empathic reactions were evaluated by experimenters who acted out emotional episodes to elicit empathy in children, and by parents who filled out empathy questionnaires. We confirmed autistic children’s difficulty attending to others, acknowledging others’ emotions, and initiating prosocial actions. However, according to parents, they did not differ from non-autistic children in emotion contagion with others’ negative emotions. Notably, autistic children showed a greater increase in prosocial actions over time than their non-autistic peers. We discussed how to interpret these findings in light of the “double empathy problem,” and stressed the importance of removing the stereotypical view of autism. Furthermore, this study was among the first to show that autistic children have the potential to learn and to improve empathy skills. Lay abstract Empathy is a highly valued human capacity. Yet, autistic people are often portrayed as lacking in empathy. Recent research, which views empathy as a complex construct emerging from multiple interrelated emotional and cognitive processes, argues that, although many autistic people do have difficulty understanding others’ emotions, and this may hinder them from responding to others in a prosocial manner, they are not indifferent to other people’s feelings. Hoping to contribute to a better understanding of the unique challenges that autistic children face in their empathy development, we followed the development of four empathy abilities: emotion contagion, attention to others, emotion acknowledgment, and prosocial actions, in 1- to 6-year-old autistic children, in comparison with non-autistic children. Once a year, for 4 consecutive years, children’s empathy abilities were evaluated by experimenters who acted out emotional episodes to provoke empathy in children, and by parents who filled out empathy questionnaires. We found that autistic children experienced indeed more difficulty attending to others, acknowledging others’ emotions, and initiating prosocial actions toward others. However, according to parents, they did not differ from their non-autistic peers in feeling along with others’ negative emotions. This indicates that it might not be the case that autistic children did not want to act empathetically toward others. Rather, they might not know how to do so. Notably, despite these difficulties, when looking at children’s developmental trajectories, autistic children showed similar improvements over time as non-autistic children. This provides evidence that autistic children have the potential to learn and to improve their empathy skills.},

However, autistic adults have difficulties accessing mental health services. The most-reported barriers to accessing treatment are therapists' lack of knowledge and expertise surrounding autism, as well as unwillingness to treat autistic individuals. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group and examined 498 adult-patient psychotherapists on knowledge about autism and self-perceived competency to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability compared to patients with other diagnoses. Psychotherapists rated their education about autism in formal training, and competency in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with autism, lowest compared to patients with all other diagnoses surveyed in the study, including those with comparable prevalence rates. Many therapists had misconceptions and outdated beliefs about autism. Few had completed additional training on autism, but the majority were interested in receiving it. Greater knowledge about autism was positively linked to openness to accept autistic patients. The results point to an alarming gap in knowledge necessary for adequate mental health care for individuals with autism. Lay abstract Most autistic adults experience mental health problems. There is a great demand for psychotherapeutic support that addresses the specific needs of autistic individuals. However, people with autism encounter difficulties trying to access diagnostic and therapeutic services. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group: a group in which autistic individuals and scientists collaborate. The group developed a questionnaire for psychotherapists in Germany to assess their knowledge about autism. Psychotherapists also rated their ability to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability, and patients with other psychological diagnoses. Many of the 498 psychotherapists that responded reported little knowledge and outdated beliefs about autism, as well as little training on treating patients with autism. Their expertise about other psychological conditions was more comprehensive. However, many psychotherapists were interested in professional training on autism. Those with more knowledge were also more open to treating autistic patients. In conclusion, psychotherapists' lack of knowledge and expertise seem to be a major barrier for adults with autism to receiving helpful psychotherapeutic support. The results demonstrate the need for an advancement in autism education during psychotherapists' training and in continuous education.},

Data from the Rochester Adult Longitudinal Study (RALS) are used to address these aims in a preregistered secondary analysis of existing RALS data (see https://osf.io/syp2u). Analyses quantify individual development of generativity in a sample of 271 RALS participants who completed the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS; McAdams \& de St. Aubin, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1992, 62, p. 1003) and the Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB; Ryff, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1989a, 57, p. 1069) during the most recent two waves of the RALS (2000–2012). Generativity demonstrated substantial rank-order stability but no mean-level change. There was substantial variability in both stability and change. Dual score change models showed a robust concurrent relationship between generativity and well-being at the first assessment and meaningful correlated change over time. While demographic and social role covariates were not associated with study findings, one of the most important limitations of the RALS is the racial and ethnic homogeneity of the sample, which constrains generalizability and potentially may restrict the range of these variables. Results are discussed in the context of our current understanding of the development and impact of generativity in later adulthood, and directions for future research in this area are identified.

  abstract = {Background: The historical focus on autism as a childhood disorder means that evidence regarding autism in adulthood lags significantly behind research in other age groups. Emerging studies on the relationship of age with autism characteristics do not target older adult samples, which presents a barrier to studying the important variability that exists in life span developmental research. This study aims to further our understanding of the relationship between the Autism-Spectrum Quotient Scale and age in a large adult sample., Methods: The present study examines the relationship of Autism-Spectrum Quotient Scale (AQ) scores with age in 1139 adults, ages 18–97 years. Participants came from three distinct samples—a sample of primarily students, a sample of MTurk participants, and a sample of primarily community dwelling older adults. The majority of the participants did not self-report an autism diagnosis (91\%), were female (67\%), and identified as White (81\%). Participants completed the AQ primarily via online surveys. Researchers scored the AQ following six common scoring practices., Results: Results of preregistered analyses indicate that autism characteristics measured by the AQ are not strongly associated with age (r values from −0.01 to −0.11). Further findings indicate that the measurement of autism characteristics is consistent across age into late life using both multiple groups and local structural equation modeling approaches to measurement invariance (comparative fit indices\,=\,0.82–0.83, root mean square error\,=\,0.06) as well as reliability analysis. Finally, demographic and autism-related variables (sex, race, self-identified autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and degree of autism characteristics) did not moderate the relationship between age and autism characteristics., Conclusion: These results suggest that self-reports of autism characteristics using the AQ do not vary strongly by age in this large age-representative sample. Findings suggest that the AQ can potentially serve as a useful tool for future research on autism across the life span. Important limitations on what we can learn from these findings point toward critical avenues for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To derive the first systematically calculated estimate of the relative proportion of boys and girls with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a meta-analysis of prevalence studies conducted since the introduction of the DSM-IV and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. METHOD: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched, and study quality was rated using a risk-of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. The pooled outcome measurement was the male-to-female odds ratio (MFOR), namely the odds of being male in the group with ASD compared with the non-ASD group. In effect, this is the ASD male-to-female ratio, controlling for the male-to-female ratio among participants without ASD. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies were analyzed, with 13,784,284 participants, of whom 53,712 had ASD (43,972 boys and 9,740 girls). The overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95\% CI 3.84-4.60), but there was very substantial between-study variability (I2 = 90.9\%). High-quality studies had a lower MFOR (3.32; 95\% CI 2.88-3.84). Studies that screened the general population to identify participants regardless of whether they already had an ASD diagnosis showed a lower MFOR (3.25; 95\% CI 2.93-3.62) than studies that only ascertained participants with a pre-existing ASD diagnosis (MFOR 4.56; 95\% CI 4.10-5.07). CONCLUSION: Of children meeting criteria for ASD, the true male-to-female ratio is not 4:1, as is often assumed; rather, it is closer to 3:1. There appears to be a diagnostic gender bias, meaning that girls who meet criteria for ASD are at disproportionate risk of not receiving a clinical diagnosis.},

Independence and well-being were assessed through direct testing, questionnaires, and interviews. Verbal IQ, beyond intellectual disability status, accounted for group differences in employment; autistic features (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Calibrated Severity Score) were uniquely related to adaptive skills and friendships. In many ways, the Never ASD group had similar outcomes compared to the ASD groups. However, lower well-being and fewer positive emotions were related to ASD diagnosis across IQ. The Ever ASD-Lower IQ group had the highest levels of irritability, hyperactivity, and medications. Families played a major role in supporting adults with and without ASD at all intellectual levels. Realistic ways of increasing independence should be developed through working with adults and their families, while acknowledging the contribution of individual differences in mental health, intelligence, and autism symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders. Lay abstract It is important to better understand how adults with autism are functioning in adulthood. Studies that have tracked individuals across the lifespan can help identify developmental factors influence differences in adult outcomes. The present study examines the independence, well-being, and functioning of 123 adults that have been closely followed since early childhood. Autism diagnosis and cognitive assessments were given frequently throughout childhood and during adulthood. We examined differences between adults who had received an autism diagnosis at some point with higher cognitive abilities (Ever ASD-High IQ) and lower cognitive abilities (Ever ASD-Low IQ), as well as adults who never received a diagnosis of autism in the course of the study (Never ASD). We found that autistic features specifically related to adaptive skills and friendships, and verbal intelligence related to work outcomes. In many ways, the Never ASD group had similar outcomes compared to the ASD groups. However, adults with ASD tended to have lower well-being and fewer positive emotions. Families played a major role in supporting adults with and without ASD at all intellectual levels. The findings suggest that realistic ways of increasing independence need to be developed by working with adults and their families, while acknowledging the contribution of individual differences in mental health, intelligence and autism symptoms across neurodevelopmental disorders.},

It is clear that historical perspectives have strongly influenced conceptualizations of autism, including the questions posed and the lenses through which data is interpreted. A review of the historical record demonstrates that while there is still much to be learned, we can be encouraged by the substantial progress that has been made since the disorder’s formal introduction to the scientific and clinical literature in the 1940s, that research into the disorder continues to grow, and that outcomes for individuals with autism have improved substantially over time.},

  abstract = {Most autistic adults struggle with mental health problems, and traditional mental health services generally do not meet their needs. This study used qualitative methods to identify ways to improve community mental health services for autistic adults for treatment of their co-occurring psychiatric conditions. We conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with 22 autistic adults with mental healthcare experience, 44 community mental health clinicians, and 11 community mental health agency leaders in the United States. The participants identified clinician-, client-, and systems-level barriers and facilitators to providing quality mental healthcare to autistic adults. Across all three stakeholder groups, most of the reported barriers involved clinicians’ limited knowledge, lack of experience, poor competence, and low confidence working with autistic adults. All three groups also discussed the disconnect between the community mental health and developmental disabilities systems, which can result in autistic adults being turned away from services when they contact the mental health division and disclose their autism diagnosis during the intake process. Further efforts are needed to train clinicians to work more effectively with autistic adults and to increase coordination between the mental health and developmental disabilities systems. Lay Abstract Most autistic adults struggle with mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. However, they often have trouble finding effective mental health treatment in their community. The goal of this study was to identify ways to improve community mental health services for autistic adults. We interviewed 22 autistic adults with mental healthcare experience, 44 community mental health clinicians (outpatient therapists, case managers, and intake coordinators), and 11 community mental health agency leaders in the United States. Our participants identified a variety of barriers to providing quality mental healthcare to autistic adults. Across all three groups, most of the reported barriers involved clinicians’ limited knowledge, lack of experience, poor competence, and low confidence working with autistic adults. All three groups also discussed the disconnect between the community mental health and developmental disabilities systems and the need to improve communication between these two systems. Further efforts are needed to train clinicians and provide follow-up consultation to work more effectively with autistic adults. A common suggestion from all three groups was to include autistic adults in creating and delivering the clinician training. The autistic participants provided concrete recommendations for clinicians, such as consider sensory issues, slow the pace, incorporate special interests, use direct language, and set clear expectations. Our findings also highlight a need for community education about co-occurring psychiatric conditions with autism and available treatments, in order to increase awareness about treatment options.},

  abstract = {Social identities relate to psychological perceptions of group memberships and form part of the self-concept. Socially identifying with groups has previously been found to associate with better mental well-being outcomes. This study first examined the factor structure and the reliability of measuring social identification in autistic adults. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a factor structure was replicated in this sample for social identification with other autistic people, but not the family. Second, the study assessed the level to which autistic adults socially identified with different groups, the total number of social identities and whether these were associated with their mental well-being. Autistic adults reported feelings of social identification with many kinds of groups, some with multiple groups, whereas others did not socially identify with any group. Stronger feelings of social identification towards other autistic people and towards one’s family, and with more groups overall, were associated with less severe self-reported depression symptoms and more facets of positive mental health. These findings indicate the importance of facilitating autistic people’s engagement with social groups. Lay abstract Social identities are groups that we are part of and influence how we think about ourselves. However, up until now there has been little examination of the groups that autistic people may belong to, and how these groups may influence their mental health. This survey-based study investigated whether autistic adults answer questions about social groups in a similar way to non-autistic non-autistic adults, including the types and number of social groups they may belong to, and whether these are associated with depression, anxiety and positive traits of mental well-being. In total, 184 autistic adults completed an online survey with questionnaires about their demographics, social groups and mental health. The results found that autistic adults reported on their social groups similarly to non-autistic people. There was a variety in the types and numbers of groups that autistic adults identified with. Some participants reported having no groups that they identified with, whereas others reported up to four groups. These included other autistic people, their family, friends, work colleagues and activity clubs among others. Autistic adults who felt connected with more groups reported better mental well-being. Feelings of connection to other autistic people and the family were also associated with better mental well-being. These results show that it is important for autistic people to be given opportunity to be part of groups that are meaningful to them, as this may be beneficial for their mental health.},

Here, we review: (1) common barriers to healthcare access (shortage/cost of services; physician awareness; stigma); (2) barriers encountered primarily during childhood (limited screening/diagnosis; unclear referral pathways), transition to adulthood (insufficient healthcare transition services; suboptimal physician awareness of healthcare needs) and adulthood (shortage of services/limited insurance; communication difficulties with physicians; limited awareness of healthcare needs of aging adults); and (3) advances in research/program development for better healthcare access. A robust understanding of barriers to accessing healthcare across the lifespan of autistic individuals is critical to ensuring the best use of healthcare resources to improve social, physical, and mental health outcomes. Stakeholders must strengthen healthcare service provision by coming together to: better understand healthcare needs of underserved populations; strengthen medical training on care of autistic individuals; increase public awareness of ASD; promote research into/uptake of tools for ASD screening, diagnosis, and treatment; understand specific healthcare needs of autistic individuals in lower resource countries; and conduct longitudinal studies to understand the lifetime health, social, and economic impacts of ASD and enable the evaluation of novel approaches to increasing healthcare access.},

While the autistic community has long identified autistic burnout as a significant mental health risk, to date, only one study has been published. Early research has highlighted the harmful impact of autistic burnout among autistic adults and the urgent need to better understand this phenomenon. Methods: To understand the lived experiences of autistic adults, we used data scraping to extract public posts about autistic burnout from 2 online platforms shared between 2005 and 2019, which yielded 1127 posts. Using reflexive thematic analysis and an inductive “bottom-up” approach, we sought to understand the etiology, symptoms, and impact of autistic burnout, as well as prevention and recovery strategies. Two autistic researchers with self-reported experience of autistic burnout reviewed the themes and provided insight and feedback. Results: We identified eight primary themes and three subthemes across the data. (1) Systemic, pervasive lack of autism awareness. (1.1) Discrimination and stigma. (2) A chronic or recurrent condition. (3) Direct impact on health and well-being. (4) A life unlived. (5) A blessing in disguise? (6) Self-awareness and personal control influence risk. (6.1) “You need enough balloons to manage the weight of the rocks.” (7) Masking: Damned if you do, damned if you don't. (8) Ask the experts. (8.1) Stronger together. The overarching theme was that a pervasive lack of awareness and stigma about autism underlie autistic burnout. Conclusions: We identified a set of distinct yet interrelated factors that characterize autistic burnout as a recurring condition that can, directly and indirectly, impact autistic people's functioning, mental health, quality of life, and well-being. The findings suggest that increased awareness and acceptance of autism could be key to burnout prevention and recovery.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A recent meta-analysis reveals almost half of autistic individuals experience some form of victimization in their lifetime, including bullying and other forms of stigma. Research among caregivers of autistic individuals demonstrates that stigma can have a long-lasting impact on other aspects of a social identity, such as self-esteem, but less research has specifically examined this among autistic adults themselves, in spite of research suggesting these are likely constructs that contribute to the internalization of stigma and subsequent mental health consequences. The current study used a mixed method approach to assess the relation between stigma and several components of social identity and social functioning. More specifically, among 45 autistic young adults, three dimensions of self-reported stigma (discrimination, disclosure, and positive aspects) were examined in relation to self-esteem, self-efficacy, social satisfaction and adaptive social functioning. Quantitative analyses revealed higher reported discriminative and disclosure stigma were significantly associated with lower self-efficacy. Increased experience with all types of stigma were associated with lower social satisfaction. Greater reported disclosure stigma was also associated with lower self-esteem. Qualitative interviewing among eight autistic young adults helped to better understand the nature of stigma and the impact of these experiences. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed that all of the participants experienced stigma in the form of exclusion or isolation and that a majority also experienced verbal bullying. Many of the negative interactions came from educators, peers, and family members. Most participants indicated that these stigmatizing interactions directly contributed to decreased social satisfaction, diminished self-efficacy, and lowered self-esteem. A greater understanding of the negative consequences of stigma can inform efforts to increase awareness and acceptance of autism.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Psycholinguistic research on pragmatics in the neurotypical population has increasingly framed pragmatic competence and related cognitive skills in terms of individual differences, co-constructed discourse, and meaning negotiation. However, research on pragmatics in the Autism Spectrum has risen from a wide and biased view of autistic communication as fundamentally compromised and autistic pragmatic abilities as impaired. Mostly due to the impactful theory of a deficit in Theory of Mind, early research on autistic communication presumed a unitary pragmatic impairment, only to find that several pragmatic abilities seem to be “preserved.” However, the interpretation of these findings usually takes an ableist turn, as most studies subsequently suggest that surface-level performance should not be interpreted as competence, but rather as a result of “compensatory” strategies. The raising number of contributions from autistic academics and participatory research enriched the field with new perspectives focusing on differences rather than impairments and drawing hypotheses on communication difficulties between neurotypes rather than within a specific neurotype. However, such contributions are hardly ever cited in the most prominent works. In conclusion, the field would benefit from a higher level of citation of autistic-led research and from an epistemological perspective shift within the mostly neurotypical academic community.},

  abstract = {Background Having a mental health condition is related to significantly lower subjective Quality of Life (QoL) for people on the autism spectrum. Many autistic people do not participate in so-called `normative' outcomes, i.e. the achievement of lifecourse goals judged to be important by adults in the general population (e.g. being employed). This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the presence of mental health conditions, subjective QoL and participation in normative outcomes in older autistic people. Methods 69 autistic people (n\,=\,48 males) aged 55 years and over were identified from two studies that are part of the UK Autism Spectrum Adulthood and Ageing research programme. Participants provided demographic data to establish normative outcome participation, and completed the World Health Organisation (WHO) QoL measure (WHOQoL-BREF) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Illustrative quotes focusing on normative outcomes were available from in-depth interviews (n\,=\,8). Results QoL scores across all domains were lower for individuals who met indicative clinical cut-offs for depression (F(8,126)\,=\,6.171, p\,{$<$}\,0.001); findings were similar for anxiety (F(8,126)\,=\,3.902, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Subjective QoL did not differ according to participation in normative outcomes (F(12,124.64)\,=\,1.363, p\,=\,0.192). The illustrative quotes suggested that aspects of daily life were related to QoL (i.e. friendships). Conclusions For older autistic people, the presence and severity of a likely mental health condition (i.e anxiety and depression) were associated with poorer QoL. However, participation in general population lifecourse goals may not well represent QoL of older autistic people, suggesting that service supports should be individually responsive.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are distributed throughout the general population; hence, understanding the correlates of aging in people with high autistic traits could shed light on ASD and aging. 915 members of the Dunedin longitudinal birth cohort completed a measure of autistic traits at age 45. A composite measure of the “pace of aging” was derived by tracking the decline in 19 biomarkers across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years. Facial age was also assessed. Reports of perceived health were collected from participants themselves, informants, and interviewers. Higher self-reported autistic traits significantly correlated with a faster pace of aging, older facial age, and poorer self-, informant-, and interviewer-rated health. After control for sex, SES and IQ, autistic traits were significantly associated with each variable: pace of aging (β = 0.09), facial age (β = 0.08), self- (β = −0.15), informant (β = −0.12), and interviewer-rated (β = −0.17) health. Autistic traits measured at age 45 are associated with faster aging. Participants with high autistic traits appear to be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, as previously reported for those clinically diagnosed with ASD. Therefore, autistic traits may have important health implications. Replicating these findings in samples of autistic people is needed to identify the mechanism of their effect on aging and physical health to improve outcomes for those with ASD diagnoses or high autistic traits. Lay Summary The role that autistic traits have in relation to health outcomes has not been investigated. We looked at how physical health and aging (measured with self-reported questions and decline in multiple biological measures) were related to autistic traits (measured with a questionnaire, at age 45). We found that higher autistic traits were associated with poorer reports of physical health, and a faster pace of aging. This suggests that both those with autism and those with higher autistic traits may be more likely to experience poorer health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum condition is associated with co-occurring physical health conditions and premature mortality. Autistic people experience multiple barriers to accessing healthcare. This study investigated autistic people's experiences of healthcare and professionals' experiences of providing healthcare to autistic people. Focus groups with 11 autistic people and one supporter, and 15 one-to-one interviews with healthcare professionals were completed. Nine themes emerged from the autistic participants' data and eight themes emerged from the health professionals' data. Three themes were identified by both groups: healthcare contacts (for improving the patient–provider relationship), making reasonable adjustments to healthcare (e.g. providing alternative places to wait for an appointment) and autism diagnosis. Autistic participants discussed the role of cognitive factors in the success of healthcare visits (such as rehearsing an anticipated conversation with the clinician the night before an appointment) and clinicians described system-level constraints that may affect healthcare delivery (such as time limits on appointments). This study identified inexpensive changes that health professionals and managers can make to improve healthcare access for autistic people. Lay abstract Research has shown that on average, autistic people are more likely to die earlier than non-autistic people, and barriers can stop autistic people accessing healthcare. We carried out a study where we interviewed healthcare professionals (including doctors and nurses), and held discussion groups of autistic people. Our results highlighted several key points: seeing the same professional is important for autistic people and clinicians; both clinicians and autistic people think making adjustments to healthcare is important (and often possible); autistic people process information in a different way and so may need extra support in appointments; and that clinicians are often constrained by time pressures or targets.},

  abstract = {Background: There is a paucity of research involving older autistic people, as highlighted in a number of systematic reviews. However, it is less clear whether this is changing, and what the trends might be in research on autism in later life. Methods: We conducted a broad review of the literature by examining the number of results from a search in three databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO) across four age groups: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We also examined the abstracts of all the included articles for the older age group and categorized them under broad themes. Results: Our database search identified 145 unique articles on autism in older age, with an additional 67 found by the authors (hence, the total number of articles in this review is 212). Since 2012, we found a 392\% increase in research with older autistic people, versus 196\% increase for childhood/early life, 253\% for adolescence, and 264\% for adult research. We identify 2012 as a point at which, year-on-year, older age autism research started increasing, with the most commonly researched areas being cognition, the brain, and genetics. However, older adult research only accounted for 0.4\% of published autism studies over the past decade. Conclusions: This increase reflects a positive change in the research landscape, although research with children continues to dominate. We also note the difficulty of identifying papers relevant to older age autism research, and propose that a new keyword could be created to increase the visibility and accessibility of research in this steadily growing area. Community brief Why is this topic important? Autistic children grow into autistic adults, and autistic adults grow old. However, there is very little research about older autistic people. This is important so we know how to support older autistic people. What is the purpose of this article? We wanted to examine how autism research activity has changed over time with respect to four life stages: infancy, childhood and adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We then more closely looked at older age autism research to point out important gaps where more research is needed. What did the authors do? We conducted a broad review of the literature on autism and described what life stages are studied in published research. We looked at how the amount of research on different life stages has changed over time. We further examined studies focused on older age and summarized the topics covered. What did you find about this topic? Our review estimates that only 0.4\% of autism-related publications over the past decade are about older autistic people. We identify 2012 as a turning point since when the number of studies has markedly increased year-on-year. Encouragingly, the percentage increase in autism research over the past decade is greater for older age research (392\% rise) than childhood/early life (196\%), adolescence (253\%), or adulthood research (264\%). What do the authors recommend? We suggest that there are many research areas that need addressing. Specifically, more research is needed on social isolation and the practicalities of living arrangements for older autistic people, as well as more studies including older autistic adults with intellectual disability. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? We do not think that our findings will immediately benefit the lives of autistic people. However, we do hope to draw attention to topics where research is needed to improve the lives of autistic older people. We also suggest that a new keyword could be created that researchers could then include in their articles to help autistic people and those interested in autism and aging find relevant writings.},

  abstract = {Background: Autistic adults have high rates of co-occurring health conditions, suicide, and premature mortality, yet often experience health care barriers and poor health outcomes. A better understanding of the health care needs and experiences of autistic adults is essential for improving the health care system and patient experience. Methods: This study examined the perspectives of autistic adults regarding their health care experiences in primary care and other settings and their suggestions for improvement using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Twenty autistic adults (aged 18–35 years, 65\% male) completed surveys and individual semi-structured interviews. Results: Qualitative data analysis results revealed 10 subthemes across 3 overarching themes: (1) system- and clinic-level factors affect access to care, (2) aspects of the clinic environment affect health care experiences, and (3) provider knowledge and practices affect health care experiences. Within the first theme, participants described barriers to obtaining services, including scheduling logistics, costs and inadequate insurance coverage, and transportation barriers. The second theme focused on aspects of the clinic environment that participants found especially relevant to their health care experiences and that required specific accommodations. This included sensory input, anxiety-provoking situations and procedures, and wait time. Within the third theme, participants emphasized aspects of providers' care that affected their health care experiences. Key factors included provider knowledge about autism, communication, rapport, and individualized care and patient–provider partnerships. Conclusion: Overall, the findings point to a need for provider training and improvements to the health care delivery system to better meet the unique needs of autistic adults.},

  abstract = {Background: A population segment of autistic adults are underidentified due, in part, to historic changes in criteria for diagnosing autism and diagnostic biases related to gender, socioeconomic status, and other individual characteristics such as intellectual functioning. Some of these individuals, described as the “lost generation,” may choose to self-diagnose. Although little is known about this population, it is possible that they share similar self-conceptualizations or internalized stigma as their diagnosed counterparts. This study reports on the structural validity of the Autism Spectrum Identity Scale (ASIS) with individuals diagnosed and self-diagnosed with autism and compares the demographic characteristics, stigma, self-concept, and quality of life of these two groups. Methods: Over 1000 adults diagnosed (n\,=\,893) or self-diagnosed (n\,=\,245) with autism were recruited through organizations serving the autism community to participate in a nationally distributed online survey that included demographic questions and measures for stigma, self-concept, quality of life, and well-being. The diagnosed data set was randomly split with exploratory factor analysis performed on a training data set. Split-half cross-validation was used to predict the factor structure of the holdout data set. Then, the full diagnosed data set structure was used to determine the generalizability of the factor structure to the self-diagnosed data set. The diagnosed and self-diagnosed were also compared for differences in gender, age, employment status, diagnostic term preference, and factors of self-concept (autism identity and self-esteem), stigma, and quality of life. Results: Factor analysis of diagnosed participants yielded a four-factor structure, consistent with previous research, with strong split-sample cross-validation and good internal consistency. Factor predictions of the self-diagnosed data set from the diagnosed data set ranged from 0.97 to 1.00 with similar internal consistency. Self-diagnosed participants were more likely to be older, women, or employed and less likely to be students or prefer the term “autism” than those with an autism diagnosis. The groups were remarkably similar in reported stigma, self-esteem, quality of life, and in ASIS factors; both groups reported lower quality of life than the general population. Conclusions: The ASIS demonstrated the same internal structure with both the diagnosed and self-diagnosed samples. The profile of self-diagnosed participants matches the profile hypothesized for the “lost generation” and others at risk of being underidentified for autism. Both populations appear to be similarly struggling with employment, stigma, and quality of life. Future research should examine whether self-diagnosed individuals meet criteria for autism or could benefit from interventions, programs, or services serving autism communities.},

Autism status was determined based on registration for disability accommodations based on autism and/or self-reports of an autism diagnosis. Health outcomes included self-rated physical health, self-rated mental health, depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. Students with autism reported poorer self-rated physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety than other students, even in the presence of controls for other disabilities. Students with autism also reported a lower likelihood of sleep deprivation and binge drinking than other students. Our results extend previous research on the health correlates of autism by considering additional indicators of health and by incorporating a direct comparison to neurotypical students. They encourage consideration of how health services for students with autism can be improved, especially for mental health problems, and argue for integrated support services that address the full constellation of physical and mental health challenges that students on the spectrum experience. Lay abstract Studies have shown that children and older adults on the autism spectrum experience more physical and mental health problems than their neurotypical peers. Less is known about the physical and mental health of college students on the spectrum. Studying college students is important because young adults on the spectrum are enrolling in college at increasing rates and because health problems can be a barrier to succeeding in college. We collected data from 2820 students at 14 colleges and universities using an online survey, some of whom had registered for accommodations based on autism and others of whom had not. We used the data to compare the physical and mental health of students on the spectrum to their neurotypical peers. Because students with autism often report other disabilities that also affect health, we accounted for whether they experienced a learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory impairment, mobility impairment, mental health disorder, or any other disabilities. We assessed health using self-reports of how healthy they were physically and mentally, and reports of depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. We found that students with autism reported poorer physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety even after taking into account other disabilities they may have experienced. They were also less likely to report sleep deprivation and binge drinking. Our results argue for developing specialized services to address the physical and mental health challenges of college students on the spectrum.},

Definitions of empathy relate to a breadth of cognitive and subjective states, often as Baron-Cohen indicates, split into ‘cognitive’ and ‘affective’ empathy. In contrast to psychopathy and narcissism, which are often characterised as resulting from deficits in affective empathy, autism have been linked to a deficit in cognitive empathy. Milton suggests that the power relationships that can form between autistic people and psych-professionals who may see their ‘patients’ as lacking in socialisation, empathy, moral competency, and even full humanity can produce forms of psycho-emotional disablement, constraining not only what people can do but also what they can be and become.},

  abstract = {The study of the evolution in the diagnosis and treatment of autism is a lesson in the dangers of medical beliefs or doctrines that are not grounded in medical science. The early descriptions of autism suggested that it was the result of childhood psychoses or psychodynamic disturbances of parent-child relationships. This flawed conceptualization of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) gave way to advances in medical science, which have established ASD as a neurobiological disorder of early brain development. There are many genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, hormonal, immunological, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological etiologies of ASD, as well as an array of gastrointestinal and other systemic co-morbid disorders. Thus, ASD are a biologically heterogeneous population with extensive neurodiversity. Early identification and understanding of ASD is crucial; interventions at younger ages are associated with improved outcomes. The advent of understanding the biological sub-phenotypes of ASD, along with targeted medical therapies, coupled with a multimodal therapeutic approach that encompasses behavioral, educational, social, speech, occupational, creative arts, and other forms of therapies has created a new and exciting era for individuals with ASD and their families: “personalized” and “precision” medical care based upon underlying biological sub-phenotypes and clinical profiles. For many individuals and their families dealing with the scourge of autism, their long and frustrating diagnostic journey is beginning to come to an end, with a hope for improved outcomes and quality of life.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a link between autistic people being misperceived by the neurotypical majority and their being at risk of poor mental health and well-being. We present a transactional account of development in which the misperceptions (and consequent behaviour) of the neurotypical majority influences the perceptions and behaviour of autistic people such that they become increasingly separate and indeed isolated from mainstream society. This jeopardizes their mental health and prevents autistic people from developing to full potential. The situation is not only problematical for the development of autistic people but is also to the detriment of wider society, in so far as autistic people are effectively prevented from contributing fully. This account assumes that some (not necessarily all) autistic people yearn to be included, to be productive and to be useful. It thus directly opposes accounts that view autism as an extreme case of diminished social motivation.},

  abstract = {Differences in social communication and interaction styles between autistic and typically developing have been studied in isolation and not in the context of real-world social interaction. The current study addresses this “blind spot” by examining whether real-world social interaction quality for autistic adults differs when interacting with typically developing relative to autistic partners. Participants (67 autism spectrum disorder, 58 typically developing) were assigned to one of three dyadic partnerships (autism–autism: n\,=\,22; typically developing–typically developing: n\,=\,23; autism–typically developing: n\,=\,25; 55 complete dyads, 15 partial dyads) in which they completed a 5-min unstructured conversation with an unfamiliar person and then assessed the quality of the interaction and their impressions of their partner. Although autistic adults were rated as more awkward, less attractive, and less socially warm than typically developing adults by both typically developing and autistic partners, only typically developing adults expressed greater interest in future interactions with typically developing relative to autistic partners. In contrast, autistic participants trended toward an interaction preference for other autistic adults and reported disclosing more about themselves to autistic compared to typically developing partners. These results suggest that social affiliation may increase for autistic adults when partnered with other autistic people, and support reframing social interaction difficulties in autism as a relational rather than an individual impairment.},

  abstract = {Importance: Existing autism assessments, interventions, and research focus primarily on deficits rather than strengths, which affects autistic people’s well-being and their physical and mental health.Objective: To develop an operational definition for strengths-based practice, develop a taxonomy to classify studies that characterize and provide strengths-based assessments and interventions, and present the impact on the mental health and well-being of autistic people of using strengths and interests in practice.Data Sources: Literature was searched from 2000 to 2021 in the CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, Web of Science, JSTOR, and ERIC databases.Study Selection and Data Collection: A five-stage scoping review framework was merged with Joanna Briggs Institute enhancements to scrutinize peer-reviewed studies written in English that characterized and provided strengths-based assessments and interventions.Findings: We sorted the 38 studies into four categories: strengths-based interventions, descriptive studies, exploratory studies, and commentaries. We found three fundamental themes: mental health outcomes, increased knowledge in interest areas, and supportive environments. Strengths-based interventions were related to positive social engagement, learning, self-advocacy, and anxiety reduction. Descriptive studies used strength assessments and examined stakeholder perceptions of strengths. Exploratory studies explored ways to incorporate strengths in practice. Finally, commentaries discussed the need to presume autistic competence and involve autistic people in research and practice.Conclusions and Relevance: Despite the small body of literature, these findings have implications for pushing the boundaries of support to center the needs of autistic people and form genuine client collaborations.What This Article Adds: This article adds to the understanding of using the strengths and interests of autistic people by incorporating their voices into occupational therapy research and practice in meaningful and purposeful ways.Positionality Statement: This article uses the identity-first language autistic people. This nonableist language describes their strengths and abilities and is a conscious decision. This language is favored by autistic communities and self-advocates and has been adopted by health care professionals and researchers (Bottema-Beutel et~al., 2021; Kenny et~al., 2016).},

  abstract = {Somatic disorders occur more often in adult psychiatric patients than in the general adult population. However, in child and adolescent psychiatry this association is unclear, mainly due to a lack of integration of existing data. To address this issue, we here present a systematic review on medical comorbidity in the two major developmental disorders autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and formulate clinical recommendations. The literature was searched using the PubMed and PsycINFO databases (2000–1 May 2016) with the keywords “[((child and adolescent) AND (Autism OR Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder* OR ADHD)) AND (“Cardiovascular Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Endocrine System Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Immune System Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Neurobehavioral Manifestations” [Mesh] OR “Gastrointestinal Disorders” [Mesh] OR Somatic OR Autoimmune disease OR Nervous system disease OR Infection OR Infectious disease)]. Two raters independently assessed the quality of the eligible studies. The initial search identified 5278 articles. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria 104 papers were selected and subsequently subjected to a quality control. This quality was assessed according to a standardized and validated set of criteria and yielded 29 studies for inclusion. This thorough literature search provides an overview of relevant articles on medical comorbidity in ADHD and/or ASD, and shows that medical disorders in these children and adolescents appear to be widespread. Those who work with children with ASD and/or ADHD should be well aware of this and actively promote routine medical assessment. Additionally, case–control studies and population-based studies are needed to provide reliable prevalence estimates. Future studies should furthermore focus on a broader evaluation of medical disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD and/or ASD to improve treatment algorithm in this vulnerable group.},

Our academic–community partnership used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 39 autistic adults and 16 people who had experience supporting autistic adults in healthcare settings. Participants identified patient-level, autism-related factors that impact healthcare interactions, including verbal communication skills, sensory sensitivities, challenges with body awareness, slow processing speed, atypical non-verbal communication, and challenges with organization. However, the success of healthcare interactions largely depended on the interplay between patient- and provider-level factors, as well as the larger context in which patients were receiving care. Provider-level factors included providers' knowledge about autism in adults, incorrect assumptions about individual patients, willingness to allow written communication, use of accessible language, openness to providing other accommodations, and skill in appropriately incorporating supporters. System-level factors included the availability of supporters, complexity of the healthcare system, accessibility of healthcare facilities, and stigma about autism. Further efforts are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the healthcare system, and decrease discrimination.},

  abstract = {A spectrum disorder is a disorder that includes a range of linked conditions, sometimes also extending to include singular symptoms and traits. The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be "not a unitary disorder but rather a syndrome composed of subgroups". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively "severe" mental disorders through to relatively "mild and nonclinical deficits". In some cases, a spectrum approach joins conditions that were previously considered separately. A notable example of this trend is the autism spectrum, where conditions on this spectrum may now all be referred to as autism spectrum disorders. A spectrum approach may also expand the type or the severity of issues which are included, which may lessen the gap with other diagnoses or with what is considered "normal". Proponents of this approach argue that it is in line with evidence of gradations in the type or severity of symptoms in the general population.},

AIMS: To examine psychiatrically relevant characteristics in autistic adult psychiatric out-patients, and to compare the characteristics with non-autistic adult psychiatric out-patients. METHOD: We assessed 90 patients who were referred to a Swedish psychiatric out-patient clinic and screened for ASD during 2019-2020. Sixty-three patients met the DSM-5 criteria for ASD or 'subthreshold' ASD. The 27 who did not meet the criteria for ASD were used as a comparison group. Assessments were made with structured and well-validated instruments, including parent ratings of developmental history. RESULTS: No differences were found between the groups regarding self-reported sociodemographic variables. The ASD group showed a higher number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders than the non-ASD group (t(88) = 5.17, 95\% CI 1.29-2.91, d = 1.19). Functional level was lower in the ASD group (t(88) = -2.66, 95\% CI -9.46 to -1.27, d = -0.73), and was predicted by the number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the need for thorough assessment of psychiatric disorders in autistic patients in adult psychiatric services. ASD should be considered as a possible 'underlying' condition in adult psychiatry, and there is no easy way of ruling out ASD in this population.},

  abstract = {Several studies report on lower quality of life for autistic people when compared to non-autistic people. However, there are ongoing discussions about the conceptualization of quality of life for the autistic population. This qualitative study investigated self-perceived quality of life in the context of autistic young adults’ everyday lives. Participants (age range 21–29 years) were recruited from a 10-year follow-up study, Lillehammer Neurodevelopmental Follow-up Study, all diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. Fourteen individual in-depth interviews were conducted. When asked about what was important for having a good quality of life, our autistic participants described relationships to people and pets as important, as well as having meaningful activities. Specific interests had guided many to their choice of both academic and work career. Many also described obstacles in their environment that had influenced their quality of life negatively, such as being misunderstood by teachers and other professionals, being bullied, and sensory and emotional overload. Our findings indicate that those in supportive roles should provide help with establishing connections to activities and people/animals, as this seems to be essential for creating a good quality of life. Taking advantage of passions and interests can create opportunities for autistic people. Findings suggest that future research should address the communication barriers between autistic people and professionals that can lead to misunderstandings. Lay abstract In this study we have asked a group of autistic young adults to describe what is important for their quality of life. The 14 participants (aged 21–29 years) were recruited from a 10-year follow-up study of autistic people. During interviews, our participants described the importance of having relationships with family, friends and pets. Having meaningful activities and being able to immerse themselves in particular interests was also reported to be important for a good quality of life. Interests had also guided their choice of what to study and what to do for work. They also spoke of how communication problems with professionals, bullying and sensory and emotional overload could have a negative impact on quality of life. Future interventions should focus on how professionals can help autistic people to connect to people/animals and meaningful activities, as the participants described this as important for having a good quality of life. These findings may be helpful in enhancing how passions and interests can be seen as opportunities for both academic and work careers for autistic people. Future research and interventions should also look at the communication barriers between autistic people and professionals, and how two-way understanding can be improved.},

  abstract = {Research studying aging in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is growing, but longitudinal work is needed. Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, altered hippocampal volumes and fornix integrity, and verbal memory difficulties compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. This study examined longitudinal aging in middle-age adults with ASD versus a matched NT group, and compared findings with cross-sectional age effects across a broad adult age range. Participants were 194 adults with (n = 106; 74 male) and without (n = 88; 52 male) ASD, ages 18–71. Participants (n = 45; 40–70 age range) with two visits (2–3 years apart) were included in a longitudinal analysis. Hippocampal volume, fornix fractional anisotropy (FA), and verbal memory were measured via T1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, respectively. Longitudinal mixed models were used for hippocampal system variables and reliable change index categories were used for Auditory Verbal Learning Test analyses. Multivariate regression was used for cross-sectional analyses. Middle-age adults with ASD had greater longitudinal hippocampal volume loss and were more likely to show clinically meaningful decline in short-term memory, compared with NT. In contrast, cross-sectional associations between increasing age and worsening short-term memory were identified in NT, but not autistic adults. Reduced fornix FA and long-term memory in ASD were found across the broad cross-sectional age range. These preliminary longitudinal findings suggest accelerated hippocampal volume loss in ASD and slightly higher rates of clinically-meaningful decline in verbal short-term memory. Contradictory cross-sectional and longitudinal results underscore the importance of longitudinal aging research in autistic adults. Lay Summary Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, differences in brain memory structures, and difficulty with memory compared with neurotypical (NT) adults. However, there are no publications that follow the same middle-age autistic adults over time to see how their brain and memory change. Our preliminary findings in a small middle-age autism sample suggest a key memory brain structure, the hippocampus, may shrink faster over 2–3 years compared with NT, and short-term memory may become more challenging for some. Across a broad adult range, autistic adults also had reduced integrity of connections to the hippocampus and greater challenges with long-term memory. In our larger sample across a broad age range, the results did not hint at this aforementioned pattern of accelerated aging. This underscores the importance of more aging research in autism, and especially research where people are followed over time.},

  abstract = {Since its initial description, the concept of autism has been firmly rooted within the conventional medical paradigm of child psychiatry. Increasingly, there have been calls from the autistic community and, more recently, nonautistic researchers, to rethink the way in which autism science is framed and conducted. Neurodiversity, where autism is seen as one form of variation within a diversity of minds, has been proposed as a potential alternative paradigm. In this review, we concentrate on three major challenges to the conventional medical paradigm – an overfocus on deficits, an emphasis on the individual as opposed to their broader context and a narrowness of perspective – each of which necessarily constrains what we can know about autism and how we are able to know it. We then outline the ways in which fundamental elements of the neurodiversity paradigm can potentially help researchers respond to the medical model's limitations. We conclude by considering the implications of a shift towards the neurodiversity paradigm for autism science.},

  abstract = {Background: Although autistic adults often discuss experiencing “autistic burnout” and attribute serious negative outcomes to it, the concept is almost completely absent from the academic and clinical literature. Methods: We used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct a thematic analysis of 19 interviews and 19 public Internet sources to understand and characterize autistic burnout. Interview participants were autistic adults who identified as having been professionally diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition. We conducted a thematic analysis, using a hybrid inductive–deductive approach, at semantic and latent levels, through a critical paradigm. We addressed trustworthiness through multiple coders, peer debriefing, and examination of contradictions. Results: Autistic adults described the primary characteristics of autistic burnout as chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. They described burnout as happening because of life stressors that added to the cumulative load they experienced, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the load. These pressures caused expectations to outweigh abilities resulting in autistic burnout. Autistic adults described negative impacts on their health, capacity for independent living, and quality of life, including suicidal behavior. They also discussed a lack of empathy from neurotypical people and described acceptance and social support, time off/reduced expectations, and doing things in an autistic way/unmasking as associated in their experiences with recovery from autistic burnout. Conclusions: Autistic burnout appears to be a phenomenon distinct from occupational burnout or clinical depression. Better understanding autistic burnout could lead to ways to recognize, relieve, or prevent it, including highlighting the potential dangers of teaching autistic people to mask or camouflage their autistic traits, and including burnout education in suicide prevention programs. These findings highlight the need to reduce discrimination and stigma related to autism and disability. Lay summary Why was this study done? Autistic burnout is talked about a lot by autistic people but has not been formally addressed by researchers. It is an important issue for the autistic community because it is described as leading to distress; loss of work, school, health, and quality of life; and even suicidal behavior. What was the purpose of this study? This study aimed to characterize autistic burnout, understand what it is like, what people think causes it, and what helps people recover from or prevent it. It is a first step in starting to understand autistic burnout well enough to address it. What did the researchers do? Our research group—the Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education—used a community-based participatory research approach with the autistic community in all stages of the study. We analyzed 9 interviews from our study on employment, 10 interviews about autistic burnout, and 19 public Internet sources (five in-depth). We recruited in the United States by publicizing on social media, by word of mouth, and through community connections. When analyzing interviews, we took what people said at face value and in deeper social context, and looked for strong themes across data. What were the results of the study? The primary characteristics of autistic burnout were chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. Participants described burnout as happening because of life stressors that added to the cumulative load they experienced, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the load. These pressures caused expectations to outweigh abilities resulting in autistic burnout. From this we created a definition: Autistic burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports. It is characterized by pervasive, long-term (typically 3+ months) exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. Participants described negative impacts on their lives, including health, capacity for independent living, and quality of life, including suicidal behavior. They also discussed a lack of empathy from neurotypical people. People had ideas for recovering from autistic burnout including acceptance and social support, time off/reduced expectations, and doing things in an autistic way/unmasking. How do these findings add to what was already known? We now have data that autistic burnout refers to a clear set of characteristics, and is different from workplace burnout and clinical depression. We have the start of a model for why autistic burnout might happen. We know that people have been able to recover from autistic burnout and have some insights into how. What are the potential weaknesses in the study? This was a small exploratory study with a convenience sample. Although we were able to bring in some diversity by using three data sources, future work would benefit from interviewing a wider range of participants, especially those who are not white, have higher support needs, and have either very high or very low educational attainment. More research is needed to understand how to measure, prevent, and treat autistic burnout. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? These findings validate the experience of autistic adults. Understanding autistic burnout could lead to ways to help relieve it or prevent it. The findings may help therapists and other practitioners recognize autistic burnout, and the potential dangers of teaching autistic people to mask autistic traits. Suicide prevention programs should consider the potential role of burnout. These findings highlight the need to reduce discrimination and stigma around autism and disability.},

Unfortunately, little empirical research exists about this population of students. In this qualitative study, 40 college and university students with ASD who were identified as academically advanced and talented and enrolled in competitive colleges and universities were interviewed about academic experiences and teaching strategies that contributed to their success. Several findings related to specific strength-based teaching and support strategies perceived by participants as contributing to their academic success. These included identifying their academic talents; interest-based extracurricular activities based; specific challenge based honors and advanced classes in areas of interest and strength; opportunities for advanced, interest-based academic experiences; participation in residential programs during high school; strong and positive relationships with teachers and counselors; developing compensation strategies that can be applied to all of these areas; and overcoming anxiety while building social connections.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Autism is a disorder with stereotyped behaviors, reduced communication skills and problems in social development. There is also high incidence of intellectual disability among the autistic individuals. However, the prevalence is increasing which may be due to changes in diagnostic procedures, practice and standards, or due to increase in incidence or may be due to diagnostic over substitution. Aim: To study prevalence of autism in patient who reported for disability. Materials \& Methods: The present study is a retrospective study which was conducted over a period of 2 and half year from July 2017 to December 2019 among all the patients who reported for disability in the Government Psychiatric Diseases Hospital Jammu. After getting clearance from the institutional ethical committee the records of all these patients seen during this period were reviewed and the diagnosis of all these patients was confirmed according to ICD 10. Results: The prevalence of autism in patients who reported for disability was 64.5\%. 76.1\% autistic patients were males whereas 23.9\% were females. 69\% autistic patients were below 6 years of age followed by 26.8\% who were in the age group of 7 to 12 years and only 4.2\% patients were between 13 to 18 years of age. Conclusion: From present study we conclude that there is high prevalence of autism among the patients who reported for disability. Hence appropriate measures should be taken up by the concerned authorities for the early identification},

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting an estimated 1 in 59 children. ASD is highly genetically heterogeneous and may be caused by both inheritable and de novo gene variations. In the past decade, hundreds of genes have been identified that contribute to the serious deficits in communication, social cognition, and behavior that patients often experience. However, these only account for 10-20\% of ASD cases, and patients with similar pathogenic variants may be diagnosed on very different levels of the spectrum. In this review, we will describe the genetic landscape of ASD and discuss how genetic modifiers such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations likely play a key role in modulating the phenotypic spectrum of ASD patients. We also consider how genetic modifiers can alter convergent signaling pathways and lead to impaired neural circuitry formation. Lastly, we review sex-linked modifiers and clinical implications. Further understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for both comprehending ASD and for developing novel therapies.},

This research used a descriptive qualitative approach by applying kinesics theory by Ray Birdwhistell. The data collection techniques were conducted by using non-participant observation techniques and documentation. The documents used to support this study were in the form of photographs and video recorder that showed the communication done by the autistic children with their teachers during the learning process in the class. The results showed that although autistic children cannot interact clearly through verbal communication, they can express their desires through non verbal communication. They can communicate by expressing it through facial expressions, eye contact, body movement, posture and touch. The meaning of the non-verbal communication expressed by each autistic child has a different meaning. This study also intended to give worthy contribution to all people who want to understand the non-verbal communication of autistic children.},

Research in this area has primarily focused on identifying the cognitive and neurological differences that contribute to these social impairments, but social interaction by definition involves more than one person and social difficulties may arise not just from people with ASD themselves, but also from the perceptions, judgments, and social decisions made by those around them. Here, across three studies, we find that first impressions of individuals with ASD made from thin slices of real-world social behavior by typically-developing observers are not only far less favorable across a range of trait judgments compared to controls, but also are associated with reduced intentions to pursue social interaction. These patterns are remarkably robust, occur within seconds, do not change with increased exposure, and persist across both child and adult age groups. However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues, suggesting that style, not substance, drives negative impressions of ASD. Collectively, these findings advocate for a broader perspective of social difficulties in ASD that considers both the individual’s impairments and the biases of potential social partners.},

First impressions were less favorable for ASD participants compared to typically developing controls across a range of judgments, but were significantly more positive when accurately labeled as ASD compared to when no label was provided, when mislabeled as typically developing, or when mislabeled as having schizophrenia. For typically developing participants, ratings did not change when accurately labeled but improved when mislabeled as ASD. Greater autistic traits for the ASD and typically developing participants were associated with less favorable first impressions, and females were rated more favorably than males. Autism knowledge of the raters, but not age, IQ, or autistic traits, was positively associated with more favorable impressions of ASD participants.

Despite growing awareness of health inequities, autistic people still report barriers to accessing healthcare. We aimed to explore the experiences of autistic people accessing healthcare, shining a light on the complex interplay of relevant factors and to explain, at least in part, the possible reasons underling health disparities and adverse health outcomes. This is a qualitative study from an autistic research team. Data were collected from 1248 autistic adults as part of a large, mixed-methods, international survey exploring barriers to primary healthcare. This article reports the qualitative findings, following a thematic analysis. Using our exploratory findings, we then constructed a model to explain the reported experiences. Respondents reported a variety of barriers. Here, our article gives voice to their stories, in their own words. Themes included: early barriers; communication mismatch; doubt – in oneself and from doctors; helplessness and fear; and healthcare avoidance and serious adverse health outcomes. Our constructed model outlines a chronological journey through which healthcare access barriers may lead to adverse health outcomes. Our findings also build on the double empathy problem, situating this in a medical context, proposing a triple empathy problem.

It is essential to classify ASD children with and without intellectual disability (ID) to aid etiological research, provide services, and inform evidence-based educational and health planning.Using a cross-sectional study design, data from 2000 to 2016 active ASD surveillance among 8-year-olds residing in the New York-New Jersey Metropolitan Area were analyzed to determine ASD prevalence with and without ID. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to identify trends for ASD with ID (ASD-I) and without ID (ASD-N).Overall, 4661 8-year-olds were identified with ASD. Those that were ASI-I were 1505 (32.3\%) and 2764 (59.3\%) were ASD-N. Males were 3794 (81.4\%), 946 (20.3\%) were non-Hispanic Black (Black), 1230 (26.4\%) were Hispanic, and 2114 (45.4\%) were non-Hispanic white (white). We observed 2-fold and 5-fold increases in the prevalence of ASD-I and ASD-N, respectively, from 2000-2016. Black children were 30\% less likely to be identified with ASD-N compared with white children. Children residing in affluent areas were 80\% more likely to be identified with ASD-N compared with children in underserved areas. A greater proportion of children with ASD-I resided in vulnerable areas compared with children with ASD-N. Males had higher prevalence compared with females regardless of ID status; however, male-to-female ratios were slightly lower among ASD-I compared with ASD-N cases.One-in-3 children with ASD had ID. Disparities in the identification of ASD without ID were observed among Black and Hispanic children as well as among children residing in underserved areas.},

A lifelong disability, or a naturally occurring form of cognitive difference akin to certain forms of genius? In truth, it is all of these things and more—and the future of our society depends on our understanding it. WIRED reporter Steve Silberman unearths the secret history of autism, long suppressed by the same clinicians who became famous for discovering it, and finds surprising answers to the crucial question of why the number of diagnoses has soared in recent years. ~ Going back to the earliest days of autism research and chronicling the brave and lonely journey of autistic people and their families through the decades, Silberman provides long-sought solutions to the autism puzzle, while mapping out a path for our society toward a more humane world in which people with learning differences and those who love them have access to the resources they need to live happier, healthier, more secure, and more meaningful lives. ~ Along the way, he reveals the untold story of Hans Asperger, the father of Asperger’s syndrome, whose “little professors” were targeted by the darkest social-engineering experiment in human history; exposes the covert campaign by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner to suppress knowledge of the autism spectrum for fifty years; and casts light on the growing movement of "neurodiversity" activists seeking respect, support, technological innovation, accommodations in the workplace and in education, and the right to self-determination for those with cognitive differences.},

The word was just one of several ideas in this work, her 1998 Honors thesis, a pioneering sociological work that mapped out the emergence of a new category of disability that, until then, had no name. And in the process, prefigured a new paradigm within the disability rights movement of the time. The work attempted a wider view of this new terrain from within a post-modern, social constructionist, feminist, disability rights perspective. Its chapters included a brief history of autism, self-exploration of Singer's life in the middle of three generations of women "somewhere on the autistic spectrum" and her research as a participant-observer on InLv, an internet community of people on the spectrum. At the same time it offered a critique of what Singer perceived to be a certain tendency towards social-constructionist fundamentalism within the disability movement, which, she argued, limited the potential of the new paradigm. This volume reproduces the original thesis with the addition of a new introduction, giving some background to the creation of the work and offering thoughts on the current neurodiversity movement.},

  abstract = {Current United States statistics suggest that autistic individuals will experience high unemployment and underemployment rates throughout their lives. Furthermore, despite the passage of federal legislation to employ young autistic adults in competitive integrated settings, where they work alongside non-disabled workers and earn at least minimum wage, most individuals receiving state services still are placed in day programs or sheltered workshops. Since meaningful employment is the most important determinant of life satisfaction, this failure is a critical societal problem, exerting increasing pressure for systems change. But the news is not all bad. Private sector companies have increased their hiring of disabled workers, producing a growing base of expertise in the recruitment, on-boarding, training, and management of autistic employees. This has led to a growing recognition that autistic individuals can be ideal workers. Autism researchers have advanced the field by investigating these private industry programs as well as conducting efficacy trials of interventions and services that help autistic individuals in the workplace. However, gaps in knowledge persist stemming from the heterogeneity of autistic workers, limited knowledge about those not receiving state services, and a system of federal services that is fragmented, poorly coordinated, difficult to navigate, and over-taxed. Autism researchers can continue to improve outcomes of autistic workers through investigations of the fit between autistic workers, their preferences, and the characteristics of available jobs, and through effectiveness trails of promising employment interventions and services that promote systems change that help break down the barriers to better integration of existing state services and resources in the United States.},

Yet might the evolution of social cognition be more complex than we assume, with more than one strategy towards social understanding and developing a positive pro-social reputation? Here we argue that social buffering of vulnerabilities through the emergence of collaborative morality will have opened new niches for adaptive cognitive strategies and widened personality variation. Such strategies include those that that do not depend on astute social perception or abilities to think recursively about others’ thoughts and feelings. We particularly consider how a perceptual style based on logic and detail, bringing certain enhanced technical and social abilities which compensate for deficits in complex social understanding could be advantageous at low levels in certain ecological and cultural contexts. ‘Traits of autism’ may have promoted innovation in archaeological material culture during the late Palaeolithic in the context of the mutual interdependence of different social strategies, which in turn contributed to the rise of innovation and large scale social networks.},

  abstract = {Objective: There has been a steady rise in research characterizing executive functioning (EF) impairments in autistic individuals but limited research investigating EF strengths. This review provides a summary of current EF research in autistic adults with a focus on EF challenges and strengths and potential sources of heterogeneity in research findings. New avenues for addressing gaps in our understanding of EF strengths are proposed. Method: A review of the EF literature was conducted. One hundred twenty-four studies of inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, fluency, planning, decision-making, and subjective measures of EF in autistic adults were included. Results: Autistic adults with average intellectual functioning demonstrate difficulties with cognitive flexibility, phonemic fluency, and working memory. Strengths in planning, decision-making, and semantic verbal fluency were evident in some but not all studies. Findings regarding inhibition are inconclusive. Key findings across each EF domain are discussed and sources of potential heterogeneity across studies were evaluated. The type of measure used appears to contribute to heterogeneous findings. Subjective EF measures revealed more consistent findings of deficits in autistic adults than objective EF measures. Conclusions: Research reveals areas of EF weaknesses as well as strengths in autistic adults. Unlike EF challenges, EF strengths are not well understood. Future research identifying EF strengths is needed to improve services and supports for autistic adults. Further investigation of potential factors that interact with or constrain EF such as comorbid disorders, verbal ability, sensory processing, and other factors specific to autism will be critical to move the field forward and increase understanding of how EF is related to everyday functioning in autistic adults.},

Multiple barriers to care were reported by adults with ASD and caregivers, including communication and sensory challenges. Adults with ASD and caregivers reported minimal use of strategies during primary care visits but indicated that those used were helpful during care. Expert PCPs reported using strategies more frequently than novice PCPs. All respondent groups endorsed that strategies had the potential to improve care in the future for adults with ASD., CONCLUSION. Opportunities exist for occupational therapy collaboration in primary health care and primary care education to improve care for adults with ASD.},

As a first step in addressing this gap in our knowledge, the current study examined cognitive functioning among older adults with elevated, but subclinical levels of autistic traits (i.e., the Broad Autism Phenotype; BAP) compared to older adults without the BAP. Method Forty older adults (aged 60–91, M\,=\,73 years) were recruited and classified as meeting criteria for the BAP (n\,=\,20) or not (control older adults, COA; n\,=\,20). Different components of executive function as well as episodic memory were measured using standardized performance-based neuropsychological assessments in addition to a self-report questionnaire of executive function difficulties. Results Despite no differences in age, sex ratio, educational history or IQ, the BAP group demonstrated poorer performance on measures of executive function and episodic memory compared to the COA group. The BAP group also self-reported more executive function difficulties in everyday settings. Moreover, differences in working memory and attentional shifting were maintained after accounting for the influences of IQ and both depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that aging with the BAP confers additional risk to cognitive function for older adults. As the BAP forms a bridge in the continuum from typical to atypical levels of autistic traits, these findings suggest that individuals with ASD might also incur cognitive costs as they age into older adulthood.},

However, this has been little studied taking a dimensional approach to autistic traits and in older age.A total of 20,220 adults aged 50–81 years from the PROTECT study reported whether they experienced persistent sociocommunicative traits characteristic of autism. Approximately 1\%, 276 individuals, were identified as endorsing elevated autistic traits in childhood and currently, henceforth the “Autism Spectrum Trait” (AST) group. An age- and gender-matched comparison group was formed of 10,495 individuals who did not endorse any autistic behavioral traits, henceforth the “Control Older Adults” (COA) group. Differences between AST and COA groups were explored in self-reported psychiatric diagnoses, self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety, and self-reported physical health diagnoses. Associations were also examined between autistic traits and health across the whole sample.The AST group reported significantly elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses compared to the COA group. Additionally, the AST group showed significantly higher self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety than the COA group. However, few differences were observed in individual physical health conditions, and no differences in total co-occurring physical diagnoses between groups. Similar associations between autistic traits and health were also found taking a dimensional approach across the whole sample.These findings suggest that older adults with elevated autistic traits may be at greater risk of poorer mental, but not physical, health in later life. Future studies should incorporate polygenic scores to elucidate the possible genetic links between the propensity to autism/high autistic traits and to psychiatric conditions, and to explore whether those with elevated autistic traits experience particular barriers to mental health care.},

They are thought to impact negatively on functionality, social interrelations and emotional well-being, although this relationship is under-explored in the literature. The personal accounts of autistic children could add valuable insight into how they experience subtle language and communication difficulties and what impact this has on their daily lives. In this study, 12 autistic children (9–14\,years), without intellectual disability, were interviewed on this topic, using specially developed methods/materials to facilitate rich self-reporting. Results showed the children could provide detailed insight into their difficulties and the impact of these on key aspects of functionality (education and daily living) and social interrelations (including friendship building). They also demonstrated a potentially bi-directional relationship between subtle language and communication difficulties and negative emotions; with negative emotions limiting communicative competence and subtle linguistic difficulties leading to negative emotional responses. This study indicates the need for further investigation into the subtle difficulties experienced by autistic children without intellectual disability and its likely impact. Implications for clinical practice include the need for better identification of subtle language and communication difficulties and provision of appropriate therapeutic services which may help to ameliorate negative functional, social and emotional sequelae.},

However, while current research often focuses on what sensory differences in autism are and which neurocognitive processes may explain these, it often does not explicitly address what it is like to experience the world through the senses of an autistic person. To explore this understudied dimension, we conducted 18 in-depth interviews with autistic individuals in order to better understand how they personally experienced hypersensitivity from a first-person perspective. Participants described hypersensitivity as a feeling of being bombarded by intrusive stimuli that seemed to invade their bodies and from which they had difficulties distancing themselves. They also indicated how due to hypersensitivity they often perceived their (social) environment as invasive, chaotic, unpredictable or threatening. Hypersensitivities were thus not only described as unsettling bodily experiences but also related to challenges in perceiving, understanding and interacting with the (social) world. By focussing on the subjective dimension of sensory processing in autism, our study thus highlights how sensory difficulties are not peripheral features of autism but play an essential part in the daily challenges faced by autistic individuals.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of autistic people entering university has increased in Australia and worldwide. While an encouraging trend, autistic students' completion rates remain much lower than non-autistic students in Australia. Perhaps unsurprisingly, numerous studies investigating autistic people's experiences at universities have identified stigma and discrimination as a significant barrier facing autistic people in higher education. In this study, our team of autistic co-researchers and non-autistic researchers co-produced an in-depth qualitative study to understand the contexts and circumstances in which autistic people felt stigmatised or experienced discrimination at universities in Australia. We interviewed 21 autistic people who either had completed at least one university course, or were studying a university course, or had enrolled in but discontinued at least one university course in Australia. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four themes: (1) `My disability is something that people just don't have a clue about', (2) `the system is really stacked against you', (3) the onus is on autistic students, and (4) `grit and stubbornness'. Based on these findings, we suggested implementing Universal Design for Learning, neurodiversity-affirming and trauma-informed practices, together with a participatory approach to better design university curricula, processes, and support services for autistic students. Lay Abstract Autistic students experience many challenges at university. One significant barrier identified in past research was autistic students' experiences of discrimination (i.e. being treat differently) and stigma (being judged differently). Our research team included both autistic and non-autistic researchers who designed a project to help explore autistic students' experiences of stigma and discrimination at Australian universities. We interviewed 21 autistic students who went to a university – some had completed qualifications, and some had not. From our interviews, we identified four themes: (1) `My disability is something that people just don't have a clue about', (2) `the system is really stacked against you', (3) the onus is on autistic students, and (4) `grit and stubbornness'. As a result, we recommended changes in the way courses are written and taught so that autistic people have opportunities that meet their ways of learning. It is also important for university staff to understand the impact of trauma experienced by autistic people and that universities work together with autistic people to design courses and supports that include autistic ways of learning, accessible university processes and identify support needs.},

  abstract = {Strengths-based approaches to autism are increasing in research and clinical practice. Such approaches suggest facilitating autistic people to increase the use of their strengths leads to positive outcomes (e.g. improved well-being). However, despite proliferation of strengths-based clinical and educational interventions, these approaches are grounded on several assumptions that remain uninvestigated. Little is known about the specific strengths of autistic people, nor their current knowledge and use of their strengths. Critically, no research has directly tested if autistic people’s strengths knowledge and use is in fact associated with positive outcomes. Conducting an exploratory study, including the first well-powered comparisons of the self-reported strengths, strengths knowledge, and strengths use of matched autistic and non-autistic samples (N\,=\,276), we found that autistic and non-autistic participants reported similar strengths. While autistic people reported lower strengths knowledge and use, strengths use in autism strongly predicted better quality of life, subjective well-being, and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Thus, strength-based approaches and clinical interventions designed to increase strengths use may pose a valuable method for boosting well-being in autism. However, we suggest such approaches should focus on individuals’ strengths more generally, rather than perceived autism-specific abilities. Lay abstract It is often suggested that supporting autistic people to identify and use their strengths will lead to positive outcomes. However, little research has explored if this is true. To date, no research has explored whether autistic people already have knowledge of and use their strengths, nor whether increased strengths knowledge and use is linked to good outcomes, such as a better quality of life, well-being and improved mental health. Comparing large samples of autistic and non-autistic people, this study tested these unanswered questions. We found that autistic and non-autistic people reported similar strengths, but autistic people reported less knowledge and use of their strengths compared to non-autistic people. Importantly however, autistic people who reported using their strengths often had better quality of life, well-being and mental health than autistic people who reported using their strengths less frequently. We, therefore, propose that supporting autistic people to use their strengths more often may be a valuable way to boost well-being in this population.},

The current review of the literature synthesizes research to determine what is currently known and presents a theoretical model of autism stigma. Autism stigma is primarily influenced by a public and professional understanding of autism in combination with interpretation of visible autistic traits. Moderating factors include the quality and quantity of contact with autistic people, cultural factors, sex and gender, individual differences, and diagnostic disclosure. Stigma can reduce well-being as well as increase the presence of camouflaging behaviors, which mask autistic traits. Caregivers of autistic people can experience stigma by association, that is, affiliate stigma, which can impact their own well-being. A variety of interventions and approaches to reduce stigma are discussed, including “autism friendly” spaces, positive media representation, educational and psychosocial training for the public and professionals, as well as cultural and systemic shifts that foster inclusivity and recognize neurodiversity.},

However, the effect sizes for implicated chromosomal loci are small, hard to replicate and current evidence does not explain the majority of the estimated heritability. Phenotypic heterogeneity could be one phenomenon complicating identification of genetic factors. We used data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, head circumferences, and ages at exams as classifying variables to identify more clinically similar subgroups of individuals with ASD. We identified two distinct subgroups of cases within the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange dataset, primarily defined by the overall severity of evaluated traits. In addition, there was significant familial clustering within subgroups (odds ratio, OR ≈ 1.38–1.42, P {$<$} 0.00001), and genotypes were more similar within subgroups compared to the unsubgrouped dataset (Fst = 0.17 ± 0.0.0009). These results suggest that the subgroups recapitulate genetic etiology. Using the same approach in an independent dataset from the Autism Genome Project, we similarly identified two distinct subgroups of cases and confirmed this severity-based dichotomy. We also observed evidence for genetic contributions to subgroups identified in the replication dataset. Our results provide more effective methods of phenotype definition that should increase power to detect genetic factors influencing risk for ASD.},

Behavioral problems that are commonly observed in autism may be related to the core features of ASD or comorbid diagnoses. Aims: To assess the prevalence of ASD in those with ID referred for disability assessment and the associated medical and psychological comorbid issues. Materials and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study that included 133 children with mild or moderate ID between 6 and 18 years of age. The study tools used were Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and a questionnaire to assess medical symptoms. Results: The prevalence of comorbid ASD in children with ID was 16.39\%. Individuals with ASD had higher behavioral problems (p = 0.001) and medical issues that included gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (constipation, p = 0.001; bloating, p = 0.03; and abdominal pain, p = 0.03) and seizure (p = 0.002). Children with severe ASD scores had higher behavioral problem scores. Conclusion: Individuals with ID who were referred for disability assessment had a significant prevalence of ASD. These children had higher behavioral problems and medical issues. It is thus important to screen for ASD in individuals with ID for better management of these individuals.},

We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association\&apos;s diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.},

In the current study, we explored parent perspectives about youth strengths during adolescence. We combined data from three studies which included semi-structured interviews about parents’ perspectives on preparing for adulthood with autistic youth. Total participants included 39 parents of 41 autistic youth (ages 12–19\,years, 88\% male). Parents of autistic youth described many strengths of their children in the context of conversations about the transition to adulthood. Thematic analysis revealed three subthemes under the broad theme of parental perceptions of strengths: diverse strengths and skills, strengths counterbalanced by challenges, and strengths with supports. Diverse strengths and skills were further categorized using content analysis and included intelligence, creativity, physical abilities, and self-care skills, which notably include some areas often perceived as weaknesses for autistic people. The findings demonstrate that parents are an important source of information about youth strengths during transition planning processes. Understanding the types of strengths that parents observe in their autistic sons and daughters can help inform the development of strengths-based interventions capable of supporting the transition to adulthood. Lay abstract Autism is a condition frequently characterized by social and communication challenges. Because most research focuses on understanding and reducing challenges, less is known about the strengths of autistic individuals. This is especially true of those who are transitioning into adulthood. We designed this research study to provide information about how parents perceive the strengths of their autistic adolescent children prior to the transition. We reviewed 39 parent interviews from previous research about how they prepare their autistic sons and daughters for adulthood. Without prompting, parents identified many strengths of their autistic children. Diverse strengths and skills they identified included intelligence, creativity, physical abilities, and self-care skills. These strengths are interesting, as they cover traits that are often thought of as areas of difficulty for autistic youth. However, parents also talked about strengths alongside challenges, and how specific supports would be needed to help their sons and daughters fully realize their strengths. These findings are important, as they help us know more about the strengths of autistic youth and how strengths can be supported when preparing for adulthood. Our findings also help reveal strengths that are particularly apparent during the transition to adulthood.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Social impairment is a defining phenotypic feature of autism. The present study investigated whether individuals with autistic traits exhibit altered perceptions of social emotions. Two groups of participants (High-AQ and Low-AQ) were recruited based on their scores on the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ). Their behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by social and non-social stimuli with positive, negative, and neutral emotional valence were compared in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to view social-emotional and non-social emotional pictures. In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to listen to social-emotional and non-social emotional audio recordings. More negative emotional reactions and smaller amplitudes of late ERP components (the late positive potential in Experiment 1 and the late negative component in Experiment 2) were found in the High-AQ group than in the Low-AQ group in response to the social-negative stimuli. In addition, amplitudes of these late ERP components in both experiments elicited in response to social-negative stimuli were correlated with the AQ scores of the High-AQ group. These results suggest that individuals with autistic traits have altered emotional processing of social-negative emotions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Prevalence estimates of autism are essential for informing public policy, raising awareness, and developing research priorities. Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male-to-female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co-occurring intellectual disability was 33.0\%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case-finding methods in diverse world regions over time. Lay Summary We reviewed studies of the prevalence of autism worldwide, considering the impact of geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates. Approximately 1/100 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the world. Prevalence estimates increased over time and varied greatly within and across sociodemographic groups. These findings reflect changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.},
